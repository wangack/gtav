[0:44:02] khulaine: You can't deny minions

[0:45:21] unknown_weeblord: I press space Also
[0:45:21] Kittyminati: camera movement is really difficult if you've never played a game like that though. Just have it auto locked for the strat
[0:45:23] khulaine: Tfw I'm on a 65% keyboard so I can't even press the f keys
[0:45:27] Albatrex9802: Trued getting back to Dota 2 after 5 years the changes made me turn away

[0:46:07] unknown_weeblord: @reshkea you should try
[0:46:11] PedroF9_: haven't played league in a couple of years, best decision i've made since everyone in Brazil is hella toxic xdx
[0:46:21] khulaine: It's even harder if you have minions hitting the enemy minions under tower
[0:46:26] binaryblade: and then midgame it changes again because your autos hurt more
[0:46:30] binaryblade: PepeLa
[0:46:35] kynichiru: PepeLa
[0:46:38] KyouMouKawaii: the one thing I can't stand about LoL, I always default to attempting to DENY
[0:46:43] Albatrex9802: Need to know how to estimate health bars and damage

[0:47:16] notnotYyhn: @KyouMouKawaii it is a hard habit to break, denying is a crutch xdd
[0:47:19] Fatealtered: deny in league is just dumping your full combo on em when they try to go for cannon minion PepeLa
