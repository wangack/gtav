[0:12:58] suliveye: I'd suggest to watch it when you got proper time for more retention which means more recommended chat
[0:12:59] dreski400: I never have anything to do so hour long videos are perfect for me especially
[0:13:04] ughitssophie: v good length vid

[0:13:38] SuaveCeelos: the real question should be...HOW DOES IT MAKE CWAY FEEL? @Crayator
[0:13:39] Darleksec64: @HollyBryds ok what is it
[0:13:47] jackrabbit567: Or just wait for the crayator  vods to post on YouTube

[0:14:19] SuaveCeelos: you mean for the cuts?
[0:14:25] ErnieSKZ: I feel that makes it easy to stay on track with what to focus on. After one game is uploaded, next game can be worked on
[0:14:27] MoneyTwit: yeah thats why im the better editor oop
[0:14:27] shadowless_warrior: U mean like the funny moment zoom ins?

[0:17:45] MoneyTwit: AHEM
[0:17:51] blade_killa: NODDERS
[0:17:53] Hydraa_: editing around a script is SO MUCH easier than putting a script into a edited video
[0:17:54] xxDentwitchxx: Hmm
[0:17:57] its_c29: @insane__08 yeahhh it could be like bloopers
[0:17:58] VioIe: ill do it for $200 per stream
[0:18:01] sahrenjade: that is understandable
[0:18:02] the_burger_boys: i honestly think with the vid that you dont need to have all achievments in the vid but just the funny moments. as well as when you were narrating it felt like you changed from your streamer voice to your normal voice and it detracted a bit from being in the vid
[0:18:02] suliveye: nothings corny in business bruva EZ
[0:18:05] the_burger_boys: ture
