[4:23:28] callhimkitten: speaking of otterbox they make good cases too
[4:23:38] jjajangmyun: i buy spigen(korean brand) very good
[4:23:52] tonyzeta: isn't otterbox a little bulky tho? PepoThink
[4:23:54] Mitchelld1990: Get a gorilla glass one
[4:23:56] who_vxm2: i use spigen too
[4:24:06] Mitchelld1990: saved my phone heaps of times LuL
[4:24:11] JustAGuyDrawing: gorilla glass is hard to break
[4:24:11] rocket_monkey: that brand is good
[4:24:21] JustAGuyDrawing: they're very good
[4:24:26] callhimkitten: gorilla glass is a tempered glass that supposed to crack before your actual phone screen cracks
[4:24:35] rocket_monkey: it works though
[4:24:46] JustAGuyDrawing: my phone actually broke before the gorilla glass did, snapped in half
[4:25:04] PavelPatzelt: @JustAGuyDrawing LUL
[4:25:09] callhimkitten: @JustAGuyDrawing depends the angle of drop, how high it dropped, its not always best.
[4:25:13] tonyzeta: I never use a case, just don't drop it 4Head
[4:25:16] Mitchelld1990: Dropped mine from high up and screen still perfect
[4:25:20] JustAGuyDrawing: I fell on it
[4:25:22] pach1nko: gorilla on galaxy not good
[4:25:27] pach1nko: its curved screen
[4:25:29] callhimkitten: but gorilla glass is best protecting your phone when it lands flat on its face from like 5-6ft drop
[4:25:32] JustAGuyDrawing: oh right
[4:25:36] pach1nko: and theres bubble in middle for fingerpreint reader
[4:25:41] pach1nko: thats why i had to go with just plastic
[4:25:48] Qvdv: @tonyzeta that's been my stategy too.
[4:25:53] jjajangmyun: spigen case was on phone which flew away recent boing airplane emergency door incident exbcQw
[4:25:57] METRO__x: cksXpeeka
[4:25:59] pach1nko: its great for flat screen but doesnt look good on curved
[4:26:00] jjajangmyun: landed safe
[4:26:11] JustAGuyDrawing: better to just get something else then
[4:26:15] rocket_monkey: better than nothing
[4:26:16] callhimkitten: get a phone case that has raised edges around the screen so if it lands flat, or on the sides, it less chance to break/crack screen
[4:26:18] pach1nko: just get the self repairing one
[4:26:35] callhimkitten: lol
[4:26:41] tonyzeta: or go get it from the store to be sure you'll have one Shruge
[4:26:42] pach1nko: idk if its exactly same
