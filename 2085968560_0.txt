[1:12:30] outlawpickle: a judge is the one who determines if its a stack, cops shouldnt be second guessing themselves so much
[1:12:31] barthy__: stacking charges is literally charging someone multiple times for the same thing, its really simple lmao
[1:12:31] TCGK_SUBZERO: it "seemed" like a stack with how you guys handled it
[1:12:33] aj42058: Dbl jeopardy & stacking are basically the same thing. One is more proper termage, one is like slang.
[1:12:34] Timskey: I agree that you should charge the right things, but at the same time I think the charges need to be evaluated a little more.

[1:12:42] 1vivy: it's like adding misdeamoner trespass and felony trespass. didn't happen
[1:12:44] ChaoticSanity: stacking is charging someone for all 15 red light violations instead of reckless driving
[1:12:45] Ragestrike: reckless evading and 26 failiers to stop.
[1:12:45] Taykum64: @bububoosh, more than likely near the end of the phase alot more when the 60 phase hits

[1:12:47] PersistentGoat: overlapping charges one on top of another over and over.

[1:12:47] lawlkat: @HurricaneHurley it is. but robbery and possession isn't. those are different charges.

[1:13:27] Frostlogic: Lesser included offenses, not stacking
[1:13:28] lawlkat: @EsfandTV the take away was though, hilarious RP came out of more charges being brought, and then reduced through trial. as intended.
[1:13:28] Mic_Stargazer: like the commercial ones
[1:13:28] Xanbry: and you get like multiple attempted murder charges if u hurt multiple people

[1:14:06] RookieNinjah: Robbery and possession at the same time? that makes no sense
[1:14:06] Switchblade142: @VacB_ No it's not. If someone steals an illegal rocket launcher from a soldier they will be charged with both robbery and possessing an illegal weapon. Same situation here.

[1:14:12] Kalious78: @esfandtv ahh but if you think about it, kidnapping someone is robbing them of there liberty
[1:14:13] Timskey: @EsfandTV I think the problem is PD has always allowed charges to be dropped as the standard, Now doing the opposite (which is the right way)seems worse and wont listen to your logic even though its better for them
[1:14:13] VacB_: But it's written into the robbery of a loa penal code that it includes taking your weapon...

[1:15:09] flocular: is this downtime longer than usual?
[1:15:09] thevaultdweller55: @Freddiepines if you read the charges technically its is
[1:15:10] yagirlsullieee: who gives a shit what Mr k got, he literally made great rp from it like he always does. it’s the name of the game
[1:15:10] SwiftStim: these damn one guys UltraMad
[1:15:11] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/HilariousBoredCrabPogChamp-Vh3iBHx-JqbeCFKv
[1:15:11] Frostlogic: It is not stacking if there are different elements of the offenses.
[1:15:11] randyrandoe: If I wasn't a stack they wouldn't be actively changing it
[1:15:11] Timskey: I think the problem is PD has always allowed charges to be dropped as the standard, Now doing the opposite (which is the right way)seems worse and crims wont listen to your logic even though its better for them
[1:15:12] sabinstha1: server up
[1:15:16] KooterNoodle: don’t worry Cornwood… you’ll find out soon! kebunSmoke

[1:15:26] UnfairAnimal: I agree, he doesnt understand it as well, that is a problem
[1:15:26] OneNiceLad: "Mr K" got mad PEPW
[1:15:27] Van_1912: he drove away without cornwood, with the stuff.  he robbed him
[1:15:29] Bundooa: mhm
[1:15:30] tarzandaking: Yes he did keep it until he was about to get caught then he dropped it
[1:15:30] Berserake: He had every intention to keep his stuff since he kept it on himself until he got caught
[1:15:30] kowalskithegreat: you could have just left it alone
[1:15:31] MesoClouds: gatsby was the only one saying its "stackable"...
[1:15:32] RoboticToy: @RookieNinjah Idk why it would be, that is what makes no sense they are completely different charges.
[1:15:32] DaltonIRL: they’re just parroting what Kebun has been saying OOC
[1:15:32] Legendoftiny: in 3.0 they eventually had a charge that encompassed all drugs robbery and kidnapping in 1 charge as long as you didn’t shoot so some people think it’s stacking
[1:15:33] BiskyRiz: he drove off with your stuff house is that not robbery
[1:15:34] papastonk741: Anyone else excited for today? The Mr. K arc is going to be wicked.
[1:15:35] ellystacklebox: Servers up
[1:15:36] ghost_x420: the charge states taking of your gear tho.
[1:15:37] flocular: is this downtime longer than usual? seems like it
[1:15:37] Connorbrow: @nibss72 They'd get charged with both, but I'd imagine they'd usually get a deal with removing one of them
[1:15:39] itzcookiebtw: @fumi_lobotomy_patient he never said that though so they wouldve never been able to know that.

[1:15:42] Xanathan420: chat, sometimes police make mistakes just like crims, it happened and they have all been able to RP the crap outta it, let it play out like it has been
[1:15:42] K4shira: it's called lesser included offenses, they are implicitly included in the greater offenses. but they can plead it down from there
[1:15:43] blahder: It was a shit show
[1:15:43] SavageTarzan: Classic it's ok, slacks will be a good officer one day xdd
[1:15:44] JumpShotHD: @EsfandTV Yuo cant get charged for robbing a bank and possession of the stuff you robbed from the bank when your caught in the act of robbing the bank
[1:15:45] insaneclowncilposse: cornwood dying anyway
[1:15:46] ExtraM1nty: posession of a gun, he had a gun on him at the time.  robbery, he robbed someone. two different charges
[1:15:47] FelipeLLs: xdd
[1:15:48] Haleos_x: i didnt know there was so many lawyers in twitch chat Classic
[1:15:49] Dave_Guyson: I feel like the dissonance comes in in that charging people for crimes is one of the only things on the server that's actually done realistically everything else is done for content/fun
[1:15:49] FelipeLLs: xdd one day
[1:15:49] HurricaneHurley: so when banks are able to be robbed, are the cops going to charge them for the robbery and possession of the money?
[1:15:49] parasocialengineer: No job queue?
[1:15:51] kingkoolkattz: brother in christ chatters stacking is pushing redundant charges that cover the same thing, if a more server charge covers the same thing as a lesser charge it would replace the lesser charge that covers the same thing
[1:15:52] Tigriopus: Long downtime= cars Pausechamp

[1:15:59] Leafyerick: @EsfandTV If K never picked your shit up off the ground he wouldn't have gotten the robbery or possession. Plain and simple. Would've just been kidnapping
[1:16:01] boGrral: Pog update saturdays
[1:16:03] DrCashew: honestly, the mistake was talking about it in front of him.
[1:16:04] Mic_Stargazer: @Legendoftiny They should do this more often to make common situations more clear, they did something similar with G6 robberies to bsiaclly encompass it all in one charge
[1:16:05] VacB_: Robbing your gun is in the penal code of Robbery of  LOA?
[1:16:05] Sprokkitt: esfandPls

[1:16:06] Xhaler79: Xhaler79 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[1:16:06] itsGenovah: the way you are trying to do it is 100% the correct way and should be the SOP but getting everyone to fall in line will take time IMO
[1:16:07] littlezoomi: bro you gotta give only one charge because these charges are not meant to be given together and this is a fact since it's a ooc charge @EsfandTV
[1:16:09] oldafman: You should of allowed charges to adjust down. It got convoluted
[1:16:10] munchkiin_: Yea, you were just laying out the charges so later court can decide which are the right charges. I heard thats what they do irl..
[1:16:11] energizergeyser: I see a lot of non subs arguing about mechanics in a server they cant even get into OMEGALAUGHING
[1:16:11] iii_governor_iii: it’s not stacking, but it appears like you are because slacks had already started and cornwood stepping in derailed what was already out there. @esfandtv
[1:16:12] Hey_Manuel: keep watching clips this stuff is redundant
[1:16:12] SumDee_LumDee: @esfandtv would you play cornwood on onx or a different character? can you even play the same character on multiple servers?
[1:16:13] RookieNinjah: @RoboticToy its been for the good of the server and RP so you dont put streamers in jail for multiple days and everyone loses content
[1:16:14] CowWizardMoneyGang: @kahlilgo wtf are you arguing for?
[1:16:17] LegitBanana_: @EsfandTV have you talked to kebun ooc about the situation
[1:16:19] MrJuicyBerry: if Mosley’s gets a restock you plan on having cornwood buy a car???
[1:16:20] yossilives: his argument is that the charges are stacked, based on 3.0
[1:16:22] boGrral: Pog downloading
[1:16:23] CROWN3R_: YOU ARE RIGHT HERE! NOO NEED TO CONSTANTLY DEFEND YOURSELF AND EXPLAIN, TROLLS WILL BE TROLLS!! @esfandtv
[1:16:24] fumi_lobotomy_patient: @EsfandTV What do you think about that he had no intention of robbing you, he was taking you hostage to someone who payed? He only took the weapons for his safety 󠀀

[1:16:41] Dontthinkson: Disarming argument is fuckin pepega. He told esfand to put the gun on the ground. Then he took the gun.  He had possession.  If he wanted to *disarm* he would tell cornwood to put the gun in glovebox himself or throw it away. Soon as K picks up gun HE HAS POSESSION what he chose to do afterwards dont matter

[5:34:00] OutKast2: Good driving
[5:34:01] lzrdwzrdtv: that is cringe
[5:34:03] shamison1: I dont mind breaking cuffs but it shouldnt be that easy
[5:34:03] Archangel3003: They need to either buff PD cars or nerf civ cars. Like you could spike that car and fire a couple of RPG's at it and it likely still would have outrun everyone LUL

[5:34:13] ExpectDragons: enough with the liberal SOP's, get shooting mizkifGun2
[5:34:14] RebornOffline: At least make Tazer semi automatic with 3 shots to combat breaking cuffs
[5:34:14] Raiden1803: Raiden1803 converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[5:34:16] Gachiguru: The civ radio is the biggest tool to be honest though
[5:34:17] TakeAChance: Swaps should be shoot on sight OMEGALUL
[5:34:17] Snackkbar: Super good chase turns into swaps into highway blasting
[5:34:17] SarahFlare: you all worked so hard for that too. super unfortunate.
[5:34:18] jdg_kalista: bike cips beat all the foot bails tbh
[5:34:21] imSteffin: footballs across the top of buildings like the first twenty minutes of Aladdin.
[5:34:22] KappaManJason: why is it in sub only?
[5:34:23] plaguedrake: if only you could pit motor cycles that come pick them up
[5:34:24] Maz0hyst: @TheBull14597 He tried to taze, missed somehow. Look like it went through her
[5:34:24] eliteone11: idk y u cant just ram bikes if they pullu p
[5:34:25] Pakkasparkers: cops need to be able to just shoot once they run someone over
[5:34:26] ZachFromChat: the footbail sucks when you know they're just running towards their 16th swap
[5:34:26] JPDoyle95: should have been able to shoot that bike imo since they ran over civilians
[5:34:28] disruptedorder: Gotta save a Taze for the driver of a swap
[5:34:30] IamLevels: Going for Bike pickup PEPW
[5:34:30] antreids: I feel like the cuffs being useless until 5+ tries is kina silly
[5:34:32] OGpicklehead: ya if you get knocked down/tazed and are surrounded by multiple cops you should be able to just break and run again
[5:34:33] harrytitsmitchell: esfandFlick
[5:34:33] shin5sato3: "PD CARS ARE OP" Pepega
[5:34:34] Gachiguru: Without the civ radio you wouldnt have as clear of swaps
[5:34:38] LHaxorP: Cornela better driver than cornwood confirmed haha
[5:34:41] Oasishydra: @Gachiguru Big thing I liked about that 80's RP server was even cops only had radio in cars
[5:34:42] OGpicklehead: shouldnt, i mean
[5:34:42] brude42: Its too easy to get away with bikes. take them off server or give cops air1 for bike pursuits imo
[5:34:47] Toastedgamer03: @KappaManJason because chat hoppers like to come in at these moments and ruin it
[5:34:47] oxphoenixo: its way to easy to break cuffs
[5:34:49] droksid00: @disruptedorder nah its time for bean bag shotguns
[5:34:49] spoonfullofrav: how can you ask for longer but you got out insta tased didnt say a word then tackled then cuffed right away LUL
[5:34:52] cocokitty: that was a long chase
[5:34:53] Bright7185: how many swaps did they do?
[5:34:54] selectedambient: that was some of your best driving though @esfandtv….maybe this is the car for you?
[5:35:04] droksid00: two round bean bag shotguns over the tazer
[5:35:05] imSteffin: if you get rid of the radio they're just going to use phones. 4Shrug
[5:35:05] fbrenha: Radio jammer for PD would be great
[5:35:07] Gachiguru: @Oasishydra esfandThinkge
[5:35:08] Spicy_Curryy: Spicy_Curryy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Pog
[5:35:13] Grilbur: Long foot bails are great. But when they just use it to stall for a pickup or swap it gets very old fast
[5:35:15] ncs_310: you probably could of used nightstick, right? because of the hitting civilians
[5:35:18] nickdrawsstuff: @esfandTV Cuffs should have a mini-game where it goes back and forth between the Cop and the Crim --- you both do the mini-game against each other and whoever fucks up loses, it gets faster each successful attempt
[5:35:19] Druedog: cops get Ws about %5 of the time

[5:39:01] General_Kumtash: It was a good chase, slightly annoying how they just GO until they literally can't.. so many crashes in that chase that sould have ended it imo
[5:39:02] Mindhysteria: yeah they flipped like 5+ times from a bike and still were mobile like what
[5:39:05] Toastedgamer03: just civ cars in general are a tank to the point that just need to show the devs all these chases KEKW
[5:39:13] nickdrawsstuff: @EsfandTV what do you think it they changed cuffs to go back and forth between the crim and cop for pressing the box at the right time, until someone screws up?  Each successful attempt makes it faster for next person
[5:39:13] Berserake: with the amount of swaps people have, they need to make civ cars paper just like pd cars
[5:39:15] SumDee_LumDee: @esfandtv genuine question, why doesn’t anyone ever go and check grove street out after goingVCB on a chase or something knowing how many crims live there?
[5:39:20] DeadlyCupid93: essaying
[5:39:24] Sazaruna: would be nice if cars at least get slower when theyre smoking or smth
[5:39:33] Archangel3003: It sucks that you stay on them for that long while their car is doing somersaults and bouncing off shit while still mobile, then you catch them and they just jump on a bike or in another car Sadge

[6:50:26] DoomerDante: is that other characters I see?
[6:50:28] derp_derpsworth: Hey dude, thank you for the stream today. My cat passed today after 17 years and it’s been nice to have the stream to kind of zone in and out of. You never know what what you do can benefit others in different ways. Thanks dude
[6:50:28] ItsDrevil: Anything over 120 is gonna chug in my experience
[6:50:29] Toastedgamer03: also btw if you do enable vsync in control panel and have gsync enabled then the fps limit won't matter
[6:50:29] lyra0702: I belive you have to do it while off the game though btw
[6:50:33] emery_steele: delete system32
[6:50:33] texern_75: delte cashe and crash files they get really full and make GTA crash on fivem

[6:50:35] h3licx: you should restart your PC EVERY STREAM
[6:50:35] cbtheg0d: i think u need to restart the apps for it to apply tho lol
[6:50:39] ActuallySupremacy: the game is already on its own PC, and its old, theres really nothing else you can possibly do. No pixel is just devastating
[6:50:45] h3licx: are you using latest graphics drivers?
[6:50:54] boGrral: u should restart daily OMEGALUL
[6:50:54] semer94: turn off 3d, make sure your game is running on ur gpu noy cpu

[6:51:10] boGrral: u should restart once per stream and at night
[6:51:10] TheNotoriousKEV: @EsfandTV try closing chrome if you have it open in the background, chrome has a nasty memory leak
[6:51:10] imSteffin: SPREADING OUT YOUR LOAD POGGING
[6:51:14] JayIngemar: @derp_derpsworth RIP cat o7 esfandL He's livin the good life in cat-heaven

[6:51:30] 1vivy: good in general
[6:51:33] MrActivated: @EsfandTV do you have Resizebar on ?
[6:51:33] VonDungus: trying to open a Japanese soda in a glass bottle was a trying experience
[6:51:38] Toastedgamer03: @shosher actually not in windows 11 it has windowed settings that make it as good as fullscreen
[6:51:38] Gachiguru: doesnt help that nopixel uses chrome somehow in their game
[6:51:38] LHaxorP: wait a min why is your mouse so huge
[6:51:38] bigfaiz: seems more like a CPU bottleneck in the south side, idk if lowering graphics will do much
[6:51:41] unenders: Just use your Task Manager to see which progra.s are using the most resources and close them from there, the unnecessary ones @esfandtv
[6:51:43] boGrral: ff7 no restart 4Head

[6:52:23] JimothyWon: does gta have e core issues?
[6:52:23] EPiQ: It's NoPixel, not your game. Their stuff is suuuuuper server-side
[6:52:24] h3licx: @Cthyllah people like you are the reason he is in denial
[6:52:26] peteryacono: 10 year old game
[6:52:26] catfish_quackenbush: You can't go by task manager for in game issues

[6:52:31] Toastedgamer03: that doesn't matter honestly

[6:53:45] Snailman22: oprea gx uses less
[6:53:45] captainnetz: thats crazy to me because I have the reverse
[6:53:45] MountainMAN1990: Chrome is soooooo heavy...
[6:53:46] EnglishBulldog: brave is based on chrome but cleaned up
[6:53:47] rizaus: With ram it's more about % free since a lot of programs take up RAM, but will freely let go of it if another program needs it.
[6:53:47] Cthyllah: but you do have 1,0000,000,000 tabs open
[6:53:47] Zeph_202: Brave is faster and uses chrome extensions

[6:53:55] ItsDrevil: Opera, the browser for gamers by gamers.
[6:53:56] the_solid_milk: chome doesnt sink like that tho, it claims the memory, but has it as priority to be given to other processes if they need it
[6:53:56] WaterLaws: @Toastedgamer03 Yep, pretty much why we reset our computers at my work everyday or else they get overloaded after some days kekw

[6:54:03] GuyInUniverse: It's a modded server there's probably gonna be some unoptimized shit that drags in your vram
[6:54:04] kylef_: OMEGALUL PERA
[6:54:04] EPiQ: chrome loses out in most browsers tests to every other option.
[6:54:05] Zeph_202: Brave is better, and lets you use chrome extensions
[6:54:09] lmaotier: opera ICANT
[6:54:12] mclovins1g: Edge is literally chrome just skinned Pepega
[6:54:14] seksmuhchine: chrome is a ram sink

[6:54:18] shiima: Go Brave
[6:54:20] rizaus: 50% free is good
[6:54:21] QCWhiteBoy: process explorer is better than task manager

[6:54:32] TheNotoriousKEV: thats wild
[6:54:32] Niconatelver: edge is better
[6:54:32] Cthyllah: opera gx is still a chrome browser
[6:54:34] RexPappa: RIGGED from the start

[6:54:41] Tarchomper: IT USES YOUR DEFAULT BROWSER
[6:54:42] TacomaWeppt: just download some more ram
[6:54:44] 9Merk: is it hardware acceleration
[6:54:45] CrystalDimension: edge is more bloated
[6:54:45] staffsergeantdavid: It helsp it you set your priority under task manager for fiveM and server as high
[6:54:46] Inz4ne_: doesnt really mater if it uses 30gb when you have 64
[6:54:46] 1vivy: bro its fine, on a 32gb system it still uses half
[6:54:46] h3licx: USE BRAVE AND KEEP NO OTHER TABS OPEN
[6:54:47] harm121: opera ftw
[6:54:47] TenderPantyz: mama mia
[6:54:47] pixelFated: set evrything to low and see if it still causes slowdown, then youll know if its a cpu bottleneck or maybe an engine/server problem
[6:54:52] renahk: the FiveM uses chromium, the engine of chrome, it does not mean it will be using whole chrome tracking which eats ram
[6:54:52] s1cKNation: edge, brave they all are chromium based
[6:54:53] Whiezy: opera is still based via chrome
[6:54:53] SereneDreams: @Zeph_202 Yeah, when they do the new change that'll make adblockers harder to use on Chrome I think I'm gonna go to Brave with Firefox as a backup for websites that can't run with Brave.
[6:54:54] halfbakedcake: Doesnt it use default browser
[6:54:55] ChaoticSanity: therefore 5M is limited by chrome
[6:54:55] BatChestington: Use brave or opera GX
[6:54:55] Bill_Collector: Right what is your default windows browser?
[6:54:55] DoveNationTV: HIT CHEIF IN HEAD WITH CROWBAR

[6:55:20] lorry_driver: FiveM uses your default browser (Chrome im assuming)
[6:55:20] GodzFire3: That's not uncommon.
[6:55:22] WolfPackk: get rid of Chrome Extensions
[6:55:23] h3licx: do you have other tabs open?
[6:55:24] ExpectDragons: Chrome is in efficiency mode, need to disable it

[6:55:26] Oasishydra: @EsfandTV don't download more ram man, someone sent me a link for it on here and it made my computer worse.

[6:55:27] Exotic_Soul: how many extensions do u have on chrome @EsfandTV  󠀀
[6:55:29] Protomateria: as long as youre not getting close to your max RAM, it shouldnt actually matter

[6:56:37] JoshTheCarrot: sometimes for certain websites
[6:56:37] GodzFire3: Chrome is built where each tab is it's own separate sandboxed process. So if you have a ton of tabs, you will have a lot of usage.
[6:56:38] kid93: LUL
[6:56:39] the_solid_milk: browsers claim a lot of memory and it shows them "using it", but it doesnt actually use it. when another process needs memory, it gives it uo

[7:05:47] Toastedgamer03: south side is just a mess honestly no pixel needs to stop with all the furniture and buyable buildings
[7:05:48] WhaleBlast: LEFT

[7:06:17] Endor: @Tyler_Flaunty thought it was me
[7:06:17] awww321: @Scottycky it is the clock speed. trust me, you dont need to worry about it. it doesnt "manage" memory"
[7:06:17] MrActivated: @EsfandTV just do system restart and the start tuning graphics
[7:06:18] santa_c7: holy shit this is from robin hood cartoon movie i love that movieeee
[7:06:19] Protomateria: @CrystalDimension is it though? i dont see other streamers drop to 30 fps lol
[7:06:20] Bill_Collector: Why would you turn efficiency mode off that makes no sense lol
[7:06:20] spicyville: jamm
[7:06:22] snusge: ApuJam ApuJam ApuJam
[7:06:24] texern_75: right click fivem and find crash log and delete the files same to the cashe files
[7:06:25] Clodhoppr: hard cap at 60 fps, keep efficiency on, and set graphics to high for now instead of highest settings
[7:06:26] TheHawksTalon: Classic
[7:06:31] Bill_Collector: That's fine bro ram usage isn't the problem
[7:06:32] Protomateria: @CrystalDimension to be fair though i dont watch a lot of other streamers
[7:06:32] WhaleBlast: only 16
[7:06:32] semer94: @EsfandTV your pc looks fine even with 50 ram usage. the prob is with the game it self. turn off nvidea 3d settings, make sure ur game is not running on cpu, if evreything is fine, update windows and graphic card, still not solved install 3rd partie like ccleaner, still not solved call a pro.
[7:06:33] pixelFated: This game runs terrible in general
[7:06:34] Toastedgamer03: efficiency mode does slow down EDGE but does nothing to chrome
[7:06:35] superdave0603: yeah try with efficiency back on I think that guy was trolling
[7:06:35] WhaleBlast: damn
[7:06:35] WaterLaws: that sounds normal
[7:06:37] Ovzzz: Its not a memory issue
[7:06:37] Synetics: I don't think ram is the issue though
[7:06:38] Oasishydra: normal
[7:06:39] yanni4100: just restart your pc
[7:06:41] OATmilked_: thats bout righ isnt it
[7:06:41] Tyler_Flaunty: It was chrome because now your cam isn't blurry Esfand
[7:06:42] Scottycky: @awww321 k
[7:06:43] Ciefon: out of 64, that's not a problem
[7:06:45] ExpectDragons: posted a Chrome fix in the discord, might help, will better for sure
[7:06:45] zhukky: cornwood eating it up
[7:06:46] CLASSiv04: turn all to low esfandTV

[7:06:46] dapyman: esfandPls critroleAshley esfandPls critroleAshley esfandPls critroleAshley
[7:06:48] Protomateria: @EsfandTV the performance has nothing to do with your RAM usage

[7:07:06] SereneDreams: Try clearing cache and cap at 120 fps @EsfandTV
[7:07:07] rizaus: Memory isn't the issue since even with chrome you have 50% free.
[7:07:09] Bill_Collector: @esfandtv rebooting after all of these changes is a good idea
[7:07:10] Protomateria: @CrystalDimension a lot of them do. but does esfand? cause the game looks like vanilla gta5 to me
[7:07:10] SMFTwistedSMF: May have to get one of the Starforge guys to come over and take a look at it.
[7:07:10] Krekdent: i have 32 and im watching your stream and my pc uses 10 gb ram

[7:07:25] Beerbuddie: Windows is going to use 16gb when you have 64 total dude.
[7:07:28] scarydisk: Maybe test by not stream and driving south side.
[7:07:29] WhaleBlast: but im a tryhard fps player
[7:07:29] FinexLive: @EsfandTV yo would start to have problems if you would be at more than 85% not 50
[7:07:31] jukla12: @EsfandTV how much free ssd space u got
[7:07:31] semer94: @look at that cpu drop, ur game probably running on cpu not gpu

[7:07:49] spicyville: just get a Tb of ram 5Head
[7:07:49] FinesseSMF: It's often an issue with the game not using multithreading properly so core 0 maxes out
[7:07:49] ExpectDragons: would overclocking memory help?
[7:07:52] Krut0r: what does your ssd/disk 0 do when fps drops?
[7:07:55] TheHawksTalon: does he use a dedicated streaming PC and gaming PC?

[7:08:07] endokei: ratJAM
[7:08:08] awww321: i would probably not set things to ultra. instead of worrying what other SW on the PC is doing
[7:08:09] MothyNZ: Im watching stream and sitting in queue and im using 10g
[7:08:09] WhaleBlast: is that a 7800x3de
[7:08:09] Speeddevilx: reboot gaming pc but first disable hardware accelleration on chrome
[7:08:12] Downthrower: make sure all stream preview windows are off. helps me
[7:08:12] KFCwakanda: it's just unoptimized 2013 shitty console port
[7:08:13] CrystalDimension: @Protomateria Pretty sure he does. There's also another option that he hasn't restarted his PC for a month LUL
[7:08:13] WhaleBlast: or that one not the best anymore?
[7:08:15] QCWhiteBoy: hey try process explorer instead of task manager

[7:08:18] shamison1: are you having issues rendering things in or you talking about the lag?
[7:08:19] Toastedgamer03: it isn't the computer honestly just how fivem works what you can do is try 60 fps cap because it won't drastically drop as much and when it does won't feel as bad
[7:08:20] spicyville: get a new PC. I hear starforge is good mhm

[7:28:33] WizardSyndicate: ron mexico Susge
[7:28:38] Brakon: someone would have to dedicate like daily clip compilation dump
[7:28:42] properenglishh: 3Head I seen pa
[7:28:47] PowerTurbo: very low Ethernet traffic … is your PC connected using WiFi? @esfandtv that would be super laggy
[7:28:48] afghanpsycho: your editors have always been incredibly slow, and they release contwnt when its no longe relevant
[7:28:48] lolveins: yeah your channel is days behind better clip channels and misses great moment
[7:28:51] jamessmyth98: I remember Spaceboy being in a similar situation with his YouTube and he revamped his channel and how it works and it seems to have blown up quite well consistently
[7:28:51] zzzzzzz8133: Keburn drops clips same day
[7:28:51] Gerald_O: @imSteffin Well... yes Kappa

[7:28:53] Cabbagepatchclown_: @EsfandTV, posting clips compilations could be good
[7:28:53] SavageTarzan: xdd
[7:28:54] Tollvikek: Yeah, it just feels delayed. When you compare if to the clip channels. #CordWood4Lyfe, but the clips just come out and keep you updated quicker.
[7:28:55] Revdudeson: I watch both. Clip channels to catch up. Esfand videos because it feels like the youtube story of cornwood
[7:28:57] un_heilig: CORNMAN
[7:28:58] coldan01: editors working overtime with how many hours you stream LULE
[7:28:58] dewwutnow: idk how the clip channels do it, but sitting through like 8+ hour streams is a math problem
[7:28:59] SavageTarzan: xdd look who's here
[7:29:02] Shmoopee: I dont think theres anything to fix. Editing a 16 hour vod isnt gonna get better
[7:29:05] Frumpis: yea there's an account called PuSe that uploads basically live and from multiple cop POVs
[7:29:10] 903gaming: operaGx equals no issues
[7:29:11] JustDrewOfficial: People fuck with GTA RP on tiktok especially cop RP
[7:29:11] khrow: clip channels are positng sometimes like 30mins after the actual thing happend, its just faster
[7:29:11] scotty2thotty18: @imsteffin there is a way to do that

[7:29:26] Maz0hyst: @SavageTarzan KEKW
[7:29:28] SMFTwistedSMF: I saw that in the comments of people complaining about them being behind. I try and tell em for one, Its from different streamers POVs and that takes awhile to edit. And if they want something recent. Watch the VOD. lol
[7:29:29] K4RLM4X: USE PROCESS LASSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[7:29:29] Ragestrike: tthey need you at the town hall to guard it

[7:32:11] KARMAincognito: heCrazy
[7:32:13] EternalCoconut: @un_heilig It's FiveM related. GTA V is not a poorly optimized game, it only runs like this on FiveM when it loads a bunch of shitty unoptimized settings, loads entire interiors if you're just nearby etc.
[7:32:15] imSteffin: @TheGodmother, that dudes got some massive little dick energy. see what I did there?

[7:33:01] PowerTurbo: did he check WiFi
[7:33:07] Bill_Collector: @esfandtv making it a habit of rebooting before every stream wouldn't be a bad idea
[7:33:11] Connorbrow: @eternalcoconut Rage is a weird as fuck, hacked together engine though, so performance is really unpredictable

[7:33:28] Tyberious79: @EternalCoconut yes and no, gtav ran badly on the class of gpu's it was released with. its the reason it takes a year to release a new rockstar game to windows.
[7:33:29] Hexonyou22_: @EsfandTV the only thing I can think about is maybe you have upscaling activated in game

[7:35:50] GlibWizard: so what happened with Siobhan's charges is she still a felon?
[7:35:50] Juiicer: his car is automatic though isnt it? how is that possible?
[7:35:52] ben_v_art: Transmission just not built to handle Bones
[7:35:53] Connorbrow: @scotty2thotty18 yeah, they make some really weird choices when designing it. Some random guy fixed the loading times in an afternoon when rockstar didn't do shit about it for 5 years
[7:35:53] dewwutnow: grind em till ya find them

[7:36:04] thegummibearmassacre: Wait, how long has there not been a green screen? Hmmge
[7:36:09] GalaticTurtle: Did Siobhan get a felony last night?
[7:36:09] HeyMeghan: didn’t Siobhan claim the car was automatic?
[7:36:11] Toastedgamer03: i don't think the people beating the car to a smoky mess earlier that day helped the transmission also KEKW
[7:36:11] Pandrax86: its an auto you cant run a gear out lol its from redlining it at 181 prolly

[7:36:35] ilmarcusil: Cornwood can't present LASO today? Until next week?
[7:36:36] Frozen_Tundras: @EternalCoconut Rockstar has more than enough resources to attain platform release parity. The more likely reason it's delayed is to make money from double dippers. Tons of people own the game on multiple platforms.
[7:36:37] eklu65: @GlibWizard she had to do a bunch of stuff in court, including converting to mormonism, but not a felony
[7:36:37] HeyMeghan: @pandrax86 that’s what I was thinking. it was probably Siobhan.

[7:37:22] Pandrax86: @HeyMeghan lol yeah. i cant see any other way unless someone just did donuts for an hour in it slipping it to stay in first
[7:37:23] dewwutnow: cornwood aint heard no damn bell tho, still "on shift"

[7:37:28] SumDee_LumDee: WOULD HAVE CAUGHT MORE IF LENNY HAWK WAS ON DUTY
[7:37:36] EternalCoconut: @EternalCoconut My GPU is basically a pocket calculator compared to what streamers who lag here run, and it actually runs GTA V base/online perfectly fine (1080p). Only racing maps with a bunch of assets in FiveM tanks it to 60 fps or so, so with south side vs. country side that's why I'm sure it isn't GTA itself

[13:42:14] Usahi_Light: It's pointless honestly, G6 workers don't get shot, they get held up
[13:42:23] CuIdra: Cornwood's armor would make the most money if it was auctioned
[13:42:23] Mattwolf325: regardless is slacks doesnt it want it to be a pd fundraiser, you could just do it privately and do the same regardless lmao
[13:42:28] DaymanF0TNM: raise $25000 to arm the criminals with 50+ vests

[13:44:04] Usahi_Light: @jordeon123 They won't be, there's literally zero benefit to shooting a G6 member vs robbing them, even robbing them is practically pointless because the payout is ass
[13:44:11] DirtyDulay: littyDaBoss littyVIP ammoFlexL esfandPPF ammoFlexR littyVIP littyDaBoss
[13:44:29] jordeon123: @Usahi_Light Thinking no one will buy the chest armor is just a bad take, but you do you
[13:44:46] klappah: @Riqui__ if theyre asking that it would already be moved forward
[13:44:53] KhrisOsaurus: ass chief HUH
[13:44:54] Lucidblood3: CORN WOOD HAS NO HOLDSETER
[13:44:56] klappah: @klappah it's daylight savings
[13:44:58] Usahi_Light: @jordeon123 It's not that no one will buy it, I never said that. There's no point in selling it to people who will only get robbed. There's zero reason to SHOOT a G6 worker because all you need to do is hold them up.

[14:33:46] zac4e: SPEEDERS SteerR
[14:33:55] irie_sen: @Usahi_Light its not burned, the whole laundering mechanic is a requirement for clean money
[14:34:02] Defonicx: they had investigations on it, knew how it worked but needed a criminal caught in the act to confirm it all on recording so that it can be used for future articulation of money order and washed cash seizure
[14:34:05] TheWholeBeef: crazy how all this progress occurs after Ruth leaves, who would’ve figured focusing on the criminals, and not your own officers, would breed success
[14:34:10] Tyberious79: @Usahi_Light its just higher risk now still viable for most
[14:34:10] khrow: @Usahi_Light it just becomes more risk reward, the crims gotta be smarter and theres still tha 90sec delay
[14:34:11] OldSlabSides: @usahi_light they can’t do anymore about it they just can take illegal cash now if they even catch them
