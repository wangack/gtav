[0:50:52] Lite_Ice: Hey they did the crime they do the time
[0:50:52] TheLastRace: @EsfandTV Jail and Processing time should not be the same as the Prison time, because of the amount of crap the PD needs to do

[0:52:00] God_is_a_cat_girl: court often feels like it ignores that it's still a game, but then uses IRL technicalities to throw out cases because the "mechanics" aren't there, so what's the point?
[0:52:01] ggsz: @BLazOR_Prime you have to remember theyre streamers so sitting in cells for hours then in prison alone isnt good content, so it makes a balance for it

[0:53:25] Slim_Shady_Mcgrady: peanut got caught because of scuff

[0:53:30] ChippieChad: probs more common to crims
[0:53:31] TrickModeX: Exactly is just like how everyone pretends to not know who ate all the food in the vending machine when we all know the reason the machine had to be refilled three times a week is because cornering is stalling in the station
[0:53:31] SimpOnMyShrimp: I’ve seen it over 10 times
[0:53:32] Wonfiii: did you get Peanut yesterday? i had to leave early

[0:53:39] Beep_Cx: peepoLegs esfandCozy WithCoffee
[0:53:39] Coop914: There needs to be some room for the reality its a buggy game sometimes
[0:53:39] Chaoszero_goc: Ramee says anything to get over on the cops as a lawyer and all the cops just fold to him
[0:53:39] killercam22: didnt that happen in the base game before?
[0:53:39] ikahala: You should meet offline and discuss it with them
[0:53:40] mclovins1g: Crims literally have a mechanic in prison to reduce prison time no?
[0:53:40] Dynomyth: You saw it at the dealership
[0:53:41] whimzyyyy: it smokes for like 5-10 mins and then starts a fire
[0:53:41] ItsCodyJ: someone earlier was going around exploiting a scuf and picking ppl up even chasing a cop
[0:53:41] ggsz: @BLazOR_Prime well ofcourse its content? if they didnt police wouldnt have content either?
[0:53:42] Janman88: if that really happens this PD and server is doomed YEP @EsfandTV
[0:53:43] GLSMarbles: I get shitlording can be funny, but when people do it to the point of ruining other people's RP it's stupid

[0:53:49] omascas: they screamed lawsuit as it exploded, didn't even RP the situation
[0:53:49] catloyalist: You might warn officers to not transport crims in smoking cars.
[0:53:49] VincentsDeath: that explains why there was only 2-3 cops on duty
[0:53:54] KappaManJason: gonna ride with anyone?
[0:53:55] CadastralDawg: Bonnie has blown up a car
[0:53:57] TheLlamaTrainer: Suing over scuff is bad faith 100%
[0:54:00] Dynomyth: You saw a cop car explode at the dealership

[0:54:01] ltl_wackman: true
[0:54:02] Real23Phil: the crime punishments in comparison to Den's 24hr irl suspension is so unfair to me
[0:54:02] Smypher: Who were the cadets?
[0:54:02] greenbaybucks: Ppl just trying to ruin other people's character
[0:54:03] Xarisher: Peanut getting caught bc of scuff isnt the cops fault, whats more concerning is the metagaming.
[0:54:03] DrWetbone: you could have an ooc talk with judge and I doubt they’d lose lawsuit
[0:54:04] comrade_raptor: it makes everything unfun
[0:54:05] Janman88: best case u with ramee yesterday yes
[0:54:05] n0oxaskek: @PsychoJoker his getaway driver disconnected and then he ran on foot and got tackled+cuffed
[0:54:07] Grumplestillskin: Adam was the GOAT yesterday

[0:54:11] Whiezy: accountability
[0:54:13] jeblowmi: are you even having fun? its hasn't sounded like it the last few days
[0:54:16] SherbertRL: Feels like lots of crims have bad faith arguments
[0:54:16] EpicOfGiggamesh: Yeah it seems kinda smooth brained to exploit cops who want to speed up your detainment process by taking things to a bench trial and then complain when the process is no longer quick because of their own actions lmao
[0:54:18] monsterinthecolsetgaming: Go out side and get some people like a person.
[0:54:18] bechcity: nah that was just Curruptwood
[0:54:19] MysticCasey: Ramee made his choice NODDERS
[0:54:21] Geralt_De_Rivia: That was such good RP though

[0:54:22] AsuniRS: KEKW
[0:54:22] Verion: kekw
[0:54:22] DrDoomie: They moved the stress mechanic to IRL instead of in game OMEGALUL Scuffed
[0:54:22] soul00001: Bad faith?? Why would they do that when you have lawyers and police rolling dice for sentencing
[0:54:23] Jeremyohno: the PD should be the one being sued, not individuals.
[0:54:23] ChippieChad: him freaking was pretty entertaining though kekw
[0:54:24] Raisha_Delos: Ramee had no idea the shit storm he was about to walk into LUL
[0:54:25] claptil: It was funny tbh
[0:54:25] God_is_a_cat_girl: IMO there's a difference between RP it out and using scuff to your advantage, some do the later but use the former as an excuse
[0:54:25] amypops25: chase with peanut was scuff to tho? when k went to pick him up his head popped?

[2:08:57] BattleAlpaca: its just connecting the weed to ramee
[2:08:59] genesissukehiro: you made cornwood assist a criminal
[2:09:03] puppietreats: @boldslowbro i think if he directly communicated it they could try to say cornwood is trying to convince a lawyer to drop a client so pd can get a W. it could be seen as coercion

[2:09:41] Gachiguru: used to be Clueless
[2:09:42] Switchblade142: @crowgoes Doesn't matter since Ramee's fingerprints were the other suspects on it, he can still be charged with it. Ramee still possessed it.
[2:09:42] Thozel: used to be LUL
[2:09:42] OminousEinherjar: @EsfandTV You saw him rob someone

[2:10:56] luxxen1: Also did you forget that Slacks implied to Cornwood that Siobhan herself might conflicted?
[2:10:59] 0Douglas: Isnt that RP at the end of the day telling him makes it less fluid
[2:10:59] Ryaht: nah, screw Ramee

[2:11:00] DannyL3tscher: the way you did it was solid, like a warning popup in a video game LUL

[2:11:09] phaden_: Pogwood
[2:11:11] nickdrawsstuff: @EsfandTV It's also in character because Ramee and Cornwood have a good relationship despite Ramee being a crim

[2:11:30] Nick_The_Mechanick: I'm pretty sure she said you could probably just copy paste it to the docket
[2:11:30] Switchblade142: @crowgoes Yeah you can. If you murder someone with an accomplice, and they catch you but not the accomplice, they can still catch the accomplice at a later time. Same situation here.
[2:11:30] possibly_ed: @iitzlegends ramee didnt have a mask for the weed stop

[2:12:00] IrishDEF: 10-41
[2:12:01] RobialT: @CabbageJuiceTim Right? Wouldnt it have been worse if he wasnt the lawyer for thee case cause then hhe might not have pled guilty? Now Rammee knows everything and the prosecution is trying to help him too

[4:21:33] Yamahamian: @Toastedgamer03 the mods do get crazy. i dont think @EsfandTV has many tho does he
[4:21:43] DeoNone: He broke the promise, shit mayor SAJ
[4:21:43] Toastedgamer03: like gta rp mods are great and fun but nothing is going to fully help what is a hackjob due to no offical modding tools and using chromium for UI KEKW
[4:21:44] Yamahamian: @Toastedgamer03 im talking about fiveM. not base settings
[4:21:52] PokeMom019: I told Suarez to get his prostate checked and he laughed esfandLUL
[4:21:58] EternalCoconut: @NonToxicant I've got a literally 9 year old GPU and GTA V runs fine (albeit on low settings) LUL it's not demanding at all. Only FiveM can be because modders can't optimize their mods and don't bother unloading anything
[4:21:59] GrenMTG: @NonToxicant ew
[4:22:02] captain_steve_420: Late for academy XD
[4:22:03] jinnytolls: Looking forward to Academy, some of the recruiters OOC are former pog cops
[4:22:11] GamingWithGardenGnomes: Just casually editing and talking to a customer and from the back we just hear "when was the last time you got your prostate checked?" Thanks for the moment of dead silence and awkward looks
[4:22:13] DoctorPez: @Yamahamian GTA 5 runs great on a 10 yr old PC. The mod is more demanding and the server backend has some isses keeping up in certain situationsu

[4:22:52] Toastedgamer03: @Yamahamian it is whatever nopixel has which still is a lot from what i gather, but not like we see the codebase also so could be no pixel code problems at the same time
[4:22:55] Wandering_Ranger: @Yamahamian on NoPixel?
[4:22:55] Yamahamian: @DoctorPez i have gta now and it runs great. i have a 3080. and ryzen 5900x.. over 100 fps consistent in fivem

[5:08:16] Xian_TV: handling more important than speed tbh
[5:08:16] sterred: Maybe they should, but cops cars have to be able to match it, thats what matters
[5:08:23] TheHawksTalon: still get out run by a biker LUL
[5:08:25] nuudelz: its a car game i guess

[5:08:36] GamingWithGardenGnomes: High speed Faster engine damage?
[5:08:36] DudeNamedSHAK: @Rukaribe its called twitch chat lol
[5:08:38] Paxipher: handling could be better
[5:08:43] justacyrus2: 10k???
[5:08:44] Nintail: running needs a boost
[5:08:48] FunkBish: Keep in mind that the guy that had been doing most of the car stuff on nopixel for years left the dev team too
[5:08:48] amavadin: 11k I think
[5:08:49] Loco_Cubano: @KieranThT insane! Snr buns is normally a peaceful place where nothing happens! Kappa
[5:08:51] Daehv: snr buns @EsfandTV
[5:08:52] Mastodonian: we need helicopters for bobby and motorcycles for archer EZ
[5:08:52] cynicalskoll: since the game runs pretty bad, the faster the car the worse the performance will be too
[5:08:54] MadderHatter: midway through 3.0 they had a power creep adjustment that slowed everything down
[5:08:55] notdustinx: need more Eugene crime
[5:08:56] BraerHZ: RP of cops vs crims, since reform obviously isnt on the table, will always be an arms race
[5:08:58] KappaManJason: Going to city council meeting?
[5:09:00] amypops25: in 3.0

[5:09:34] Lanterno: is the stabbing still active?
[5:09:35] kippenkopp: i think its because cars might not be as fleshed out in 4.0, like maybe they are focusing on criminal aspects of the game
[5:09:35] EmDuBB13: down officer
[5:09:37] Shakeboxing: What happened to the guy you arrested last evening before the storm with heaps of weed? :)
[5:09:40] bigfaiz: dash
[5:09:45] Paudelly: I think they went a little too fast too early on this. Garbage trucks and tow trucks pushing the same speed as a cruiser? Slower speed chases early on would have been perfectly fine and given plenty of room to grow over time
[5:09:46] evilmnkey4: compony
[5:09:55] sterred: @EsfandTV In any case, you shouldnt need to personally go to so much work just to get your police cars to a point were you can viably catch people. Imagine if none of the officers were interested in tinkering with the cars.. Devs need to keep a closer tab on car stats
