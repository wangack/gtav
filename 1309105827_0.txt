[2:13:43] ArJayHeart: if they are not on the app they cant get fleeca
[2:13:43] sixfivesun: Probably max

[2:13:50] venkaramon: insta cash is a big factor
[2:13:54] undead198: max sounds better
[2:13:55] ryy89: Make them choose before they start the job whether they want flat fee or payout dependent
[2:13:57] grandpachen: small crew definitely will be more incentivized with max money
[2:13:58] Ghst69rdr: 300 per bag up front payout no wait time, I think anyone would take that
[2:14:20] queerlorax: yeah that sounds great
[2:14:21] booteejuice69: @UberHaxorNova if its really complicated add in the cash but if its the revolving door ones just max
[2:14:26] ZeroMoonGuard: Plus the RP
[2:14:27] sunbrewed: could always give them the choice
[2:14:28] Purplevivid: then you would have to clean the money through the locals to get hte money back or lose 20k
[2:14:38] OAFox: could they take minimum if it meant a higher tier job the next time?
[2:14:40] LolmanScott: opportunity and some LL merch
