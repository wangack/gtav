[0:41:34] lunorx6: tony still think this is 3.0 xd

[2:28:19] 1AwkwardButterfly: @sbarnard5 exactly, weird take from lang
[2:28:31] orlandito03: didn‚Äôt Marty join thinking everyone had equal say
[2:28:31] SandSeref: eatt
[2:28:32] NiteSeek: marty's a thinker Thinkge GladgeBusiness
[2:28:49] KrisCat: @orlandito03 no, he was told there were dons at the top lol
[2:29:25] woolsCW: harrNom harrNom harrNom harrNom harrNom harrNom
[2:29:27] orlandito03: @kriscat could‚Äôve swore when he spoke to lang it was everyone has a say kinda thing
[2:30:10] 1AwkwardButterfly: bring it up or its not his conecren, im confusedSo
[2:30:16] orlandito03: bring it up but it‚Äôs not your concern
[2:30:27] 1AwkwardButterfly: @orlandito03 exactly
[2:30:45] KrisCat: @orlandito03 i mean, everyone can say what they want, but there's no way they can have equal say if there are dons at the top.
[2:31:11] orlandito03: @kriscat yeh but lang just said it‚Äôs not your concern haha
[2:31:18] Spectacrow: o7
[2:31:19] Fvshi7: no way he says it
[2:31:58] honestnandaba: bro is reaching
[2:31:58] Sablotron: Hmmm
[2:32:04] its_ajc: i mean its fair
[2:32:14] zGomazou: Don madgeNOW
[2:32:19] KrisCat: it isn't his concern to try to improve the system. that's for the dons. @orlandito03
[2:32:24] orlandito03: more of a captain thing
[2:32:25] CuppaT_XYZ: Don NoThanks
[2:32:35] TropicalToucan: Didn't you just tell Martin to keep doing heists
[2:32:37] TropicalToucan: LUL
[2:32:52] Deathchampt: Raid leader
[2:32:53] 1AwkwardButterfly: @KrisCat but how can the dons improve the system if they dont get feedback?
[2:32:54] TropicalToucan: He wants to be a voice in BUTC sounds like\
[2:32:59] coreythebut: 1 raiders from coreythebut have joined! 
[2:33:24] ThePepperPeople: hmmm
[2:33:24] harkolly: Raiders üî•üî•
[2:33:34] KrisCat: @1AwkwardButterfly getting feedback and having equal say isn't the same thing. i'm sure if marty tried to provide feedback w/o stirring up the "scamming" drama, it would be received differently.
[2:33:39] orlandito03: @kriscat I get if the dons have a final say but lang is coming off as he doesn‚Äôt have a day
[2:33:45] seeare_: he wants to be the mickey of the group i think?
[2:33:50] 3hops: he wants to be on the same level as the Dons it sounds like
[2:33:55] neonplantss: Well if is good at heists
[2:33:57] Donboyuk: Heist crew captain think he wants
[2:33:58] QuackstheRubberDuck: @seeare_ that's what im thinking
[2:34:13] OmegamonX: this is a huge leap that marty just made am I the only one seeing that?
[2:34:16] neonplantss: Yeah like a raid leader
[2:34:35] Nightbot: @lotuslime -> I'm only trying to help. [stop posting links] [warning]
[2:34:44] TropicalToucan: Marty might want to see how the group operates on a heist first
[2:34:53] hydreixy: How are they still at a meeting
[2:34:53] wOnG_ManDoO: like the company? LUL
[2:34:54] KrisCat: @lotuslime gotta put a space after that period lol
[2:35:34] TropicalToucan: Lowkey I feel like the second server farm gets this shit a little confusing
[2:35:36] orlandito03: @kriscat lang literally said it‚Äôs not your concern‚Ä¶ I get dons gets the final say but ‚Äúit‚Äôs not your concern‚Äù = keep your mouth shut
[2:35:39] sbarnard5: marty just needs to leave imo....hes just going to continue being minimised otherwise
[2:35:39] 1AwkwardButterfly: @KrisCat just saying it doesn't make sense, im not sure where he thinks he's an equal bringing up falws in the money system
[2:35:45] OmegamonX: why would that go to marty though, he went from nearly excommunicated to capo?
[2:36:03] TropicalToucan: Lang and Marty need Gigi to translate for each other
[2:36:04] Panoramic_Views: throw him a bone lol
[2:36:05] pootie2goood: He would be great for that role. He is the first person in the city to hit two Ammunation crates at the same time. Went great too.
[2:36:28] pootie2goood: Gigi translates hand holding good
[2:36:32] seeare_: yuno and marty being co raid leaders would be so good LOL
[2:36:32] woolsCW: makes sense but I dunno if Lang wants to give up control in that area
[2:36:34] KrisCat: it's rp at the end of the day. It'll work out how it works out.
[2:37:08] TropicalToucan: Lowkey the second BUTC farm is kinda makes it annoying
[2:37:11] orlandito03: @kriscat yeh I dc it just feels like Lang is either real hard on Marty or doesn‚Äôt like him
[2:37:25] Cambymamby: thats sick
[2:37:33] JMaker24: Yuno would welcome Marty suggestions on a stack
[2:37:34] FRASB0: This has gone from... Get in line to Can I be a shadow Don.
[2:37:47] TropicalToucan: Harry LULW
[2:37:50] orlandito03: @kriscat better than everyone just saying yes to everything tho
[2:37:59] mateoHRV: jesus harry
[2:38:05] AnitaBowl: when was the last time this group did any heist?
[2:38:10] neonplantss: because he wants to be in the main crew
[2:38:24] THEgoodCOW: holy
[2:38:25] OmegamonX: @Harry the crew app doesnt allow for that being freeform
[2:38:29] Panoramic_Views: he wants a title
[2:38:46] tahoemac: @Panoramic_Views vp of butcoinneering
[2:38:55] woolsCW: He wants a captain role without being a soldier first
[2:38:58] Panoramic_Views: captain butcoin
[2:39:01] woolsCW: is the problem
[2:39:01] TropicalToucan: Combine the farms Prayge
[2:39:06] szilopsybinh: He wants to be included in "The Crew"
[2:39:10] OmegamonX: wait so he has a 60btc/day AND a 80btc/day farm?
[2:39:24] TropicalToucan: @OmegamonX no the crew house is 56-60 ish
[2:39:33] OmegamonX: ah ok
[2:39:59] Iron_PTMN: yo :)
[2:40:02] OmegamonX: the fact he has a 80/day farm seems pretty insane already
[2:40:18] ch0rdee: ch0rdee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! harrWarry
[2:40:58] slapch33ks: I gotta say I'm so confused on how this organization is supposed to work and what the underlings get out of the structure. LUL
[2:41:07] TropicalToucan: I feel like one big farm would make it less confusing
[2:41:08] Pdmac779: sounds like Marty wants to farm heists for the crew
[2:41:24] Xterminator24: I don't think Marty is ever going to be happy here TBH.
[2:41:30] AnitaBowl: Marty is a better leader of the heist crew just because Yuno isn't assertive enough
[2:41:45] TropicalToucan: ^
[2:41:54] OneEgg: I mean he has already shown more passion over it than anyone else
[2:41:58] OmegamonX: @Xterminator24 things can always be mended
[2:42:00] THEgoodCOW: @Xterminator24 i think he will, if not all what he say are getting shot down as a shit idea
[2:42:12] Hendrics: do it Marty, you can do it now
[2:42:25] FreshPosty: the heist treasurer
[2:42:29] Hendrics: thats what the meetings are for, ya?
[2:42:36] JMaker24: this is just Marty trying to convince lang and lang saying no
[2:42:37] HarryBaals7: @THEgoodCOW Yup....everything Lang says is no
[2:42:43] orlandito03: @xterminator24 it seems like Marty is trying to make it work, it‚Äôs just if the rest of the crew will let him
[2:42:49] Panoramic_Views: i think Lang is actually right in this he can just do this with his own initiative he doesnt need to ask to do this
[2:43:11] coca_clouds: cant just marty use his own coin and pull people from the crew?
[2:43:14] Hendrics: love how Gigi is the translator between them LUL
[2:43:14] TropicalToucan: I think he has some really cool ideas for BUTC but I think having 2 separate farms makes it confusing with CREW BUTC that he doesnt really have control over
[2:43:14] famine999: Marty wants to be the Butt treasure
[2:43:21] THEgoodCOW: @orlandito03 kinda not the rest, only lang atm is shooting it down
[2:43:31] ktothec99: Having the person most passionate about it, also 'lead' it sounds extremely valuable
[2:43:45] orlandito03: @thegoodcow true
[2:43:46] slapch33ks: @panoramic_views but if Marty is using his own farmed bcoin to do the heists then why even involve the crew
[2:43:58] orlandito03: he wants to do it with the crew
[2:44:18] orlandito03: or at least have a say in it
[2:44:38] JMaker24: voting time
[2:44:48] Hendrics: so lets do it
[2:44:52] thetypicalcasual: Sounds like dons could just say yes and see where it goes
[2:44:53] MagnitudeGaming: he wants tonys spot its clear
[2:44:54] Hendrics: move forward, lets go
[2:44:59] Thatgooey: harrRat
[2:45:00] genrol: what is Luci talking about
[2:45:01] FaithfulBullet: Gege and Luc get it lol
[2:45:05] perox89: don of the dons
[2:45:16] PwnUWithEz: Sounds like Marty trying to take a admin assistance position and give it the title of manager
[2:45:19] HarryBaals7: It would be a development role. Lang doesnt understand that.
[2:45:31] ulti_feeeeeeeed: He wants to be a don
[2:45:41] TropicalToucan: I feel like lang is getting annoyed now LUL meeting going sour
[2:45:48] Rool_Gonzalez: consilieri
[2:45:49] uncultured: leadership != control freak
[2:45:52] AnitaBowl: lang is always annoyed though
[2:45:53] orlandito03: @ulti_feeeeeeeed think it would be more of a captain role
[2:46:02] trungthiendo: basically what gang hierarchy goes
[2:46:03] FaithfulBullet: There's a leadership void that he's trying to fill. Gege and Luc see the need for it. That's the point
[2:46:03] FRASB0: Martin is a character that needs his ego stroked constantly
[2:46:04] mortaldictata117: he wants a title that feels like it has some merit to it
[2:46:05] Thatgooey: here we go again imagining things PepeLaugh
[2:46:12] SpilledNuts: I don't get it
[2:46:13] OmegamonX: @uncultured why in god's name would martin get a leadership role?
[2:46:14] Hendrics: LUL
[2:46:14] Conf1gs: KEKW
[2:46:15] Iron_PTMN: KEKL
[2:46:16] lunate87: so back to gang hierachy KEKW
[2:46:17] spudd710: lol
[2:46:20] Xyr0_22: He just wants to find his place in the crew
[2:46:23] Conf1gs: he's a pure adhd andy KEKW
[2:46:25] PuroCapi: Wants some sort of leadership role that he may not have earned yet
[2:46:25] ulti_feeeeeeeed: @orlandito03 captain ,don , president same difference
[2:46:28] Shagzkrieg: So just say you don't want his butcoin
[2:46:28] m0hx000: LUL
[2:46:29] Jakieran: Lang isnt gonna give up 'control' of something like that
[2:46:31] sbarnard5: i have that same feeling LUL
[2:46:34] FRASB0: Make Lang laugh
[2:46:37] honestnandaba: the wall would be more understanding
[2:46:40] uncultured: @OmegamonX Not saying he should at all, just that the way he described it sounds like he wants to be a leader not a control freak
[2:46:40] emilia_mila_: you're a don!! you got this
[2:46:41] v1kt0r1986: i think the dons don't understand how much money is behind butc and he wants to make money with it
[2:46:42] JMaker24: fuck it helldivers 2?
[2:46:43] TropicalToucan: He probably doesn't feel right taking the crew BUTCoin without Don permission which doesnt let him schedule heists
[2:46:43] Hendrics: or Marty just isnt benig clear about what he wants
[2:46:47] Xterminator24: Circles around just begging for confirmation. LUL
[2:46:54] orlandito03: @ulti_feeeeeeeed no don is the top‚Ä¶ Captain would just be the leader of a certain thing
[2:46:59] drukkz: tell him to fuck off BasedGod
[2:47:00] virol0ne: Man if only he knew about capo responsibilities
[2:47:02] andress_sanchez: You guys are trying hard not to understand Marty
[2:47:04] orlandito03: still report to a don
[2:47:22] OmegamonX: the fact is martin can do everything he said already and this just shows he isnt proactive
[2:47:24] sbarnard5: cant cumstack this hard without Nino being present
[2:47:27] Hendrics: yep
[2:47:27] genrol: he has a 80 buttcoin farm just go hit shit whenever you want
[2:47:32] TossTheBomb: "Make me a don"
[2:47:34] uncultured: Hes afraid because he would be told no lol
[2:47:36] Rool_Gonzalez: in this bassin fits only 5 sharks,others are baitfish
[2:47:38] MMRhoninx: @andress_sanchez sao true
[2:47:40] JessCee7: If he do it, he'll be told that he's overstepping that why he's asking for permission now I think
[2:47:45] drukkz: he knows what he wants but doesn't want to say it
[2:47:48] FaithfulBullet: He wants to say it, but once he says it, there's not going back
[2:47:49] drukkz: KEKLEO
[2:47:49] Thatgooey: peepoTalk
[2:47:50] Panoramic_Views: i mean you guys are handing out captain roles to other people he's basically asking for that but does he actually deserve it at this point
[2:47:51] reshawnguides: Chat chill the leader has spoken its simple just come on the next heist LUL LUL
[2:47:56] Deathchampt: Is Marty a don
[2:47:57] UncarvedMatt: He knows what he wants to do he should just do it idk what this back and forth is about
[2:47:58] zGomazou: Marty the top don madgeNOW
[2:48:01] OmegamonX: @andress_sanchez well damn maybe he should explain better then
[2:48:05] tahoemac: @Deathchampt no
[2:48:09] mendog1: Marty was a gang leader so its natural for him to lead stuff, bottom line soldier role wont work
[2:48:10] TropicalToucan: So he is using his own BUTC for "crew" heists ?
[2:48:12] deadpaint_tm: He‚Äôs too smart and detail oriented for the crew

[2:48:29] FRASB0: Well said...
[2:48:36] FaithfulBullet: I thing he's saying he wants to lead with you not be in control
[2:48:40] pootie2goood: @omegamonx the thing is Marty is a very Proactive character in the city. First to do alot and figure stuff out. He just is looking for affirmation, he needs it from lang. All he is looking for
[2:48:41] FaithfulBullet: Think*
[2:48:52] BlewUpLP: The Wall standing his ground, hell yea
[2:48:59] JMaker24: be organic Marty like watah
[2:49:16] Thatgooey: im pretty sure ive heard this whole conversation at least 92 times now vadeSmile
[2:49:17] saxxon540: He's asking for permission to do stuff he's already able to do... He'd have to ask to spend crew coin anyway
[2:49:28] OmegamonX: @pootie2goood well that doesnt matter in terms of the crew though, its nice that he is proactive for his own gains, but what is the use of that gift when he doesnt bring it into the business
[2:49:29] uncultured: but please this conversation is draining my braincells at this point
[2:49:30] FaithfulBullet: He's probably wondering why he has to prove that
[2:49:36] lunate87: he did say he got a 80 Butcoin farm
[2:49:55] BlewUpLP: IMO he's basically asking to be made a don
[2:50:07] saxxon540: @BlewUpLP Nah he's asking for responsibility
[2:50:21] OmegamonX: luc is sub HUH
[2:50:34] uncultured: @OmegamonX OMEGALUL
[2:50:58] Thatgooey: PauseChamp

[2:51:08] Xterminator24: The silence. LUL
[2:51:10] BlewUpLP: Not happy with that lol
[2:51:17] FaithfulBullet: Oh no lol
[2:51:30] pootie2goood: @omegamonx he already has brought it into the buisness brother. Crew would even have guns without Him. Big thing though is he has the casino waiting to open. Which no one realizes how rich that is about to make everyone involved
[2:51:32] ulti_feeeeeeeed: He bout to leave üòÇ
[2:51:33] uncultured: silence speaks volumes...
[2:51:39] FaithfulBullet: Marty was leading GG while Luc was working security at roosters. He's leaving lol
[2:51:42] woolsCW: if that's not good enough omg
[2:51:44] Shagzkrieg: Earn the opportunity to give away his coin ok

[2:52:27] eastcoast_99: crazy oh boy üçøüçøüçø
[2:52:28] Diggy_waffle: just seem like Marty not a follower

[2:52:34] lunate87: you are already overstepping the meeting KEKW
[2:52:38] deadpaint_tm: he and Yuno might just became the two man hacker free agents. I was cracking up how Yuno was participating with the company yesterday
[2:52:42] ianakaBoogie: harrSuffer
[2:53:06] uncultured: this is like RP'ing the spiderman meme
[2:53:07] lunate87: yea true KEKW
[2:53:12] Gucio37: ilya didn't say "give me a head of weed and then I;ll start working on it", he was doing the job, doing it well and then he got ofically recogized for it

[3:59:50] Sword_Scream: How highly does brown value getting a new house after the further revelation of Tony being "found" right outside of the house with a gun, and PD might've seen Octo go in?
[4:00:04] CuppaT_XYZ: it not on steam?
[4:00:12] Scarchitect: any old rap heads remember delinquent habits?

[4:02:16] Aumilly: @tahoemac that im not sure
[4:02:19] Sword_Scream: I'd say it's three bandaids. Cops are less likely to spend time up in mirror park than in the southside, Chang Gang aren't your neighbours, and the key reset could also be a huge positive.
[4:02:28] KrisCat: harryPls
[4:02:28] OmegamonX: I give it 24 hours until confusion arises again
[4:02:47] woolsCW: @tahoemac Lang did say that, yes, but they seem to have other priorities at the moment
[4:02:53] shiifon: true hope he doesn't over think it again and start thinking it work diffrently
[4:02:54] EmeraldTiger888: was it that the conversation was redundant or that it shouldnt have happened at all
[4:02:56] Aumilly: @Sword_Scream or unless CG moves to Mirror park too
[4:03:01] tahoemac: @woolsCW ty
[4:03:14] Sword_Scream: @Aumilly Would be hilarious if they moved into the blue house after the crew moves into the brown one

[4:04:01] Aumilly: i could be over anticipating it
[4:04:10] tahoemac: you ever try any candy from the vending machine in the still?
[4:04:42] Sword_Scream: @Aumilly I think Arush will have a reaction to Ramone being gone, until it's properly explained, and he'll be a bit upset about losing a gun. But overall he's just happy it hasn't all burned to the ground yet.
[4:04:48] harkolly: @aumilly i cant wait to hear the Thailand stories in his stream tbh i bet he's had a great time and some cooked things üòÇüòÇüòÇ
