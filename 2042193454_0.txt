[0:43:02] lordsell: is it possible to change your shift? @Deansocool
[0:43:04] 1CaptainRedBeard1: If this was real life you guys would be on your way to unionizing so fast.
[0:43:04] Money2Much: why dont u ask ooc to be in high command thats always a option

[0:43:19] keemotherapi: there's no way she isn't lying today
[0:43:21] captain_steve_420: I kinda think they should say there's cameras at the docks so that theres an rp excuse for the captains to watch the clips and see for themselves
[0:43:30] ltl_wackman: i think it deleted because it made a url

[0:44:14] eaglezFly: Its annoying that we could lose denzel cop rp over this deansoSadge
[0:44:15] DronerBTW: If Bobby gets sentenced, is it possible that he'll get life chat?

[0:44:22] MakiWind: She maybe making example of you
[0:44:23] captain_steve_420: @scairyterry Theres a comes a point tho where if you're getting in trouble and losing your job over something you didnt do, where it stops being fun rp
[0:44:23] Cheexur: meeting starts at 4 den zel will be there at 4:05 lol
[0:44:23] HarryPatel: time to cut the grass my boy

[0:44:41] ScreenFresh: @DronerBTW i think life in prison is only consent based.
[0:44:41] 1CaptainRedBeard1: They got Peanut down there?
[0:44:44] jazzym7633: PENUT?
[0:44:54] pupuiih: Naahh bro is still talking abt it he's traumatized
[0:44:56] assley_toe: problem is that there are 2 seniors words against 2 cops and 1 already has 7 daps, its a tough fight
[0:44:56] charybdes: What is scarier to me is that Slacks said he believed in corrective actions before Daps then voted to Dap you up on the first 4. I don't get it, almost feels scripted.
[0:45:01] wackojacko165: big up beavo the beaver ahahahahahah that guy doesnt even chew his food lmao
[0:45:02] bobdang07hd: if they only knew how den acted in the courtroom at that bench trial
[0:45:03] zac4e: I think you said something along the lines of: I'm done answering questions, because we are just talking in circles
[0:45:05] Cultivated: Nah peanut not awake
[0:45:05] CowZ_Moo: the worst part is that ruth believes she is doing the correct thing
[0:45:13] Cultivated: bro doesn't wake up until after storm
[0:45:14] Panos_97: Abdul
[0:45:18] otgfacial: Peanuts not awake yet

[0:45:28] ComplexPandaSinger: ye its weird, maybe the statement was given under emotions
[0:45:29] Megajackpot: Washeeed caaaash
[0:45:30] charybdes: It is bs.
[0:45:30] pukanacua: they made their decision before talking to you
[0:45:31] Coop914: they gaslighting you hard
[0:45:31] captain_steve_420: Yeah Slacks was gaslighting you
[0:45:33] xypher85: @PuSeYT @Deansocool DonoWall
[0:45:33] bobbybeee: slacks and turner have chatted.. but ruth daps as  she explains
[0:45:37] zac4e: True
[0:45:37] wackojacko165: big up beavo hahahaha
[0:45:38] 1CaptainRedBeard1: The RP is fun. But yeah, upper management in the PD is a disaster right now.
[0:45:39] UncleJinx: Worst part is if you don't get fired. You got to see them everyday knowing they lied about you.
[0:45:41] doggensteinn: daps are worse than terroism in RP
[0:45:41] Cheexur: being told is talked to tho
[0:45:42] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)

[0:45:49] n8dogg03: anytime you were making a good point Slacks would change the subject
[0:45:49] charybdes: lol
[0:45:49] julieannxox: KEKW
[0:45:49] Faildude: everyone has their own recolection of what happened in a heated argument
[0:45:49] krish0604: Turner talked to you once remember after the 3 daps situation !!
[0:45:50] lakis_myk: LUL
[0:45:51] otgfacial: This is supposed to be the building of the p, d, but they keep tearing you down
[0:45:53] thomas1874x: They deffo made their decision before talking to you
[0:45:53] zac4e: Cornwood W

[0:45:57] x_pinecone: KEKW
[0:46:00] Etexio: does jason still money to den?
[0:46:00] 360ski: Just my take on the situation, but I think Rolo was so upset because she was not expecting Dens and Aziz to show up and they were in the middle of doing shady corrupt cop stuff!
[0:46:01] OfficialTriggerPlays: @xypher85 LMFAO
[0:46:03] Blkjckss: what’s good dean and chat. Everybody have a good one deansoGVO
[0:46:03] SergioZ444: o7 PepeLaugh
[0:46:04] amanmama: I don't think denzel will get the daps
[0:46:04] danielb2705: The only time you've had a proper conversation with Ruth is when you signed that raid warrant
[0:46:06] Etexio: owe*
[0:46:10] assley_toe: to think this could have all been avoided if the senior officer spoke to you like a human
[0:46:13] amanmama: 3 daps*

[2:16:28] oiamrack: whats happening right now
[2:16:29] kb420ps: The more "loosely" Captain Ruth throws out police procedures,  the easier it is for her to issue extreme punishment.  There's no clarity, so it leaves her open to wield her DAP powers without discretion.
[2:16:40] Zunnun: @minich4rmander you know they saw them both on scene right  that's why it's conflicted
[2:16:43] Clivent: ask command

[2:39:06] JustinBinder: yeah but why state washed money why not just have regular cash on there
[2:39:10] quaylewastaken: Then why is it different
[2:39:11] TheKingOfWit: I mean, RP has weird logic, but if the money is washed and that's the only reason to wash money, it's obv
[2:39:11] BLazOR_Prime: @HeyMeghan he was told to set up some rules/SOP's and get it up and running until they hire a permanent position
[2:39:14] justind33: You can argue you left it in your clothes when you put them in the wash
[2:39:14] sidemenlife: sidemenlife subscribed with Prime.

[2:39:27] BobFromAccounts: Anymore break through on the Suspicious Financial Activity @Deansocool ?
[2:39:28] liveleak_playz: if nopixel washing money is the same as laundering money then it is highly illegal

[2:41:16] slymox: @ramsin50 yeah, it seems cartoonishly literal
[2:41:18] eatcheese0: @ramsin50 yeah its a meme
[2:41:24] xl_scout_lx: @Deansocool you don't seem near as anxious today about the meeting. Good for you bud.
[2:41:27] dondain7: you would have to find the money being washed at the time the you could take their washed cash for processed of crime but that would have to happen every time washed cash is found that’s my understanding

[4:46:55] armedgolem01: @Killsauce correct so how would it being even less profitable be better for a company like amazon this looks like what companies do when they are at rock bottom
[4:46:56] jsaint_98: twitch can run on a deficit because of amazon parent company
[4:46:57] Vandal_Savage_: 40/60
