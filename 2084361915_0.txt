[0:53:54] AntleredCormorant: @carcool12 ive seen a thing where it was like a basic amount of materials, metal plastic etc depending on the parts involved
[0:54:19] JWM0420: Sentry saving phone numbers? new leaf, turned.
[0:54:41] youngbruffboy: davis is a vet now
[0:54:44] JWM0420: I personally am the worse at that shit IRL... I just assume I'll know who it is later based on the convo, never works like that
[0:55:33] JWM0420: yeah, having a unique 10 digits is wack
[0:55:55] JWM0420: would be nice if your last 4 digits was your state id
[0:56:05] JWM0420: make the first 6 the same for everyone
[0:56:20] FuusionFreenzy: sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB sentryHB
[0:56:26] Gahele: did you pay your 100$ fine from yesterday ?
[0:56:29] AntleredCormorant: @JWM0420 thats actually p smart
[0:56:59] lockedheart7: with age of cell phones there are a lot more area code mixing in cities since you don't have to change your number when you move anymore but yeah, for a game mechanic it's silly
[0:57:01] LordCBK: Do you have to sell the weed to other players?
[0:57:08] AntleredCormorant: well.. until you want someone to call you w/o knowing your real ID
[0:57:10] JWM0420: like every number should be (555) ###-[State id]
[0:57:35] kylelaible: 5.
[0:57:46] jarrodbruner: start breaking peoples kneecaps. Wont be running anywhere
[0:57:47] MalletMark: its the suit. it was the difference maker
[0:58:19] JWM0420: @antleredcormorant the only issue I see with it would be when you use state id to pay for shit, they just would get your phone number by default
[0:58:24] BoDizzle05: they good
[0:58:29] NooseLooseSnooze: do payphones still exist nowadays?
[0:58:39] carcool12: so how do you remove points on your liscence, Time or traffic school?
[0:58:41] BoDizzle05: has davis been pulled over yet?
[0:58:47] carcool12: @NooseLooseSnooze only in dense areas
[0:58:48] JWM0420: but even then I still see it as a good idea to keep the first 6 static for everyone so you only have to remember 4 digits
[0:58:51] ZogTiger: love how you say that while blowing through 4 red lights LUL
[0:59:08] JWM0420: @bodizzle05 3 times.
[0:59:23] durty1252: Sir you can't park there.
[0:59:24] JWM0420: @bodizzle05 his police interactions include:
[0:59:45] Jarrod_tv: All the pay phones in Australia are free calls to standard and mobile numbers, has been for years
[0:59:58] lockedheart7: at least they're not towing your actual car while you park the short bus
[1:00:16] kylelaible: Alvar
[1:00:23] Moobot: Welcome somalian_santa! bleedPurple
[1:00:23] LordCBK: Davis spend 15 minutes screaming at a cop yesterday
[1:00:26] ChazRambone: Continues to park in a no parking zone LUL
[1:00:34] JWM0420: @bodizzle05 Getting questioned for beating someone with a bar and not having taxi license. running a red and having a warrant. stealing cars and running from the cops, and he got pulled over for running a red and got a ticket. he also got stopped by wrangler for illegally parking but that was mainly to question him about some folks he was with
[1:00:34] carcool12: @lockedheart7 shh i've been praying for it to happen every time
[1:00:48] JWM0420: bat* not bar
[1:01:29] carcool12: Its Italian you have to go

[1:03:02] gvwolf: LUL if they had of seen that red light ....
[1:03:02] JWM0420: hey sentry, is there a character you've like toiled with but couldn't quite figure out how to get going so it's just like somewhere in there, or is everything kind of find an identity and leave it open ended and see what happens?
[1:03:31] gvwolf: I noticed the increased presence too
[1:04:17] Robkeebler: i remember when emmit was a mute....
[1:04:26] bladedge28: there is always a plan but when you get going that plan does not always go how you want it.
[1:04:29] Robkeebler: well, just mumbled
[1:04:47] balthazor6: Jesus was fun
[1:04:47] FowlEric: you havent mentioned WD or MIchael Michaels have you?
[1:04:50] Deafy_Z: @Robkeebler some of the best days
[1:05:00] JWM0420: that's actually smart.... like then you come into it with a whole 20 point personality
[1:05:06] SgtDingleberry: Alright...
[1:05:11] JWM0420: instead of a 1 dimensional thing
[1:05:22] FowlEric: 2 tours in boot camp
[1:05:31] JWM0420: if the cops could have gotten to Emmett first... imagine
[1:05:39] lockedheart7: Seemed like Emmet ended up a refined hybrid of a lot of your ideas
[1:06:03] Inspdrey: no suit today?
[1:06:11] Soraffe: A lot of character design and RP is having goals for your character but being open minded to things, not saying your character will do crime because your character has to have their limits but you can't flush every single thing. A lot of the fun is improv
[1:06:14] JWM0420: like you feel out the audience find what they respond to and lean into that
[1:06:24] AntleredCormorant: i like playing hobo types for that reason
[1:06:25] gvwolf: bob rossing his way through
[1:06:31] JWM0420: but instead of an audience, in this case it's the other roleplayers
[1:06:50] J_Wedge: Ziggy is the only one of your characters that I dont like, most of all his laugh. But hey, cant like em all I guess.
[1:07:15] JWM0420: well I mean audience in terms of stand up
[1:07:15] percidus_: LUL

[1:08:22] FowlEric: or just bill burr it and tell the audience they sucks for 14 minutes
[1:08:37] JWM0420: so who's your favorite like 3 stand up comedians
[1:08:39] 1800SLAT: have you done standup yet?
[1:08:42] AntleredCormorant: @FowlEric shit on everything they value. Legend.
[1:08:46] JWM0420: obviously it's all subjective but just curious
[1:09:09] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: i just hit bulletpoints in my head
[1:10:01] carcool12: Just look at Chappelle's specials he opens and closes with instigating jokes and it goes viral
[1:10:11] Cerokoss: I live in a small town. there was several comics that came to play a local bar. first dude gets up and does exclusively abortion jokes. The second guy came up and pointed out how stupid that was. He flowed his material in with making fun of this other guy who clearly didn’t read the area of the country he was in.
[1:10:49] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: nice man
[1:11:13] carcool12: they're clippable jokes
[1:11:50] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: trying to be edgy is cringe, if its natural its good
[1:12:12] cantsleep3AM: OMEGALUL
[1:12:36] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: bill hicks wannabes
[1:12:59] Cerokoss: Ya doing dark humor to just do it ain’t the way.
[1:13:24] jarrodbruner: it's lazy
[1:13:38] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: warm up act
[1:14:46] DudeWheresMyTARDIS__: stand up is a business end of day and bookers dont take risks they cant afford to
[1:14:59] bobeebin: that guy who said he jacks off looking at his dad tho
[1:15:01] torijinosa: Hey sentry! caught up on the VOD last night, some really good storylines going on!

[1:18:28] Antalissa: I love that he is aggressively nice even when upset
[1:18:33] jovansjj: Malignant
[1:18:41] JWM0420: I know this is unlikely but it would be so awesome if Davis managed to never go down and the first time he does, it's Perma territory
[1:18:44] Newbranch: The stress induced hemorrhoids masked the cancer.
[1:18:48] JWM0420: that would be pretty sick
[1:19:08] Mattigins: Doesnt benign mean not dangerous?
[1:19:14] ChazRambone: Took a right in the left lane
[1:20:03] LeftCross: Wow no sprunk?
[1:20:07] PieVsCaake: …..
[1:20:10] jarrodbruner: ?
[1:20:11] cantsleep3AM: monkaHmm
[1:20:13] JWM0420: wait you actually could possibly fight that ticket though. technically you made a right on red. which is legal, the actual offense you committed was an illegal turn
[1:20:47] PieVsCaake: …….
[1:20:53] Soraffe: Uhhhh
[1:21:03] curlythanos: ?
[1:21:14] Soraffe: @JWM0420 He made a right on red from the left lane LUL

[1:21:18] Turbul_: wait whats going on with the fast food joints?..
[1:21:38] AntleredCormorant: @Turbul_ trying to force ppl to food trucks i guess
[1:21:58] LeftCross: I'd need the lore on that one
[1:22:17] Shade_91: its the mayors idea is what i heard
[1:22:21] J_Wedge: The problem with food trucks is you never know where they are.
[1:22:23] JWM0420: @soraffe still, he didn't illegally go thru a red, the turn was illegal... the red light was not the issue
[1:22:37] youngbruffboy: someones posisoned the water hole!
[1:22:38] itisTeddy: For a while people were kidnapping clucking Bell employees and forcing them to work at up and atom to make it seem like plucking Bell wasn't ever having employees
[1:22:50] jovansjj: Really?!
[1:22:59] Turbul_: ah ok

[1:23:43] carcool12: as much as cluck n bell is cool, I have to support the In-n-Out equivalent in this world
[1:23:48] itisTeddy: The reasoning behind it is employees of food trucks can't survive because the prices of the fast food joints
[1:23:49] Turbul_: onx has some really good lore going with the nuclear fallout and now limited resources
[1:23:50] AntleredCormorant: havent noticed a food truck in sandy yet but someone's sure to step up
[1:23:50] curlythanos: KEKW

[1:24:02] curlythanos: oh okay
[1:24:03] TobeyTobes93: double line only means no passing

[1:24:16] JWM0420: I could also see the argument to reduce how many options there are to congregate the roleplay.
[1:24:17] LordCBK: On a single way road yes, on a double way I'm not sure
[1:24:27] gvwolf: i always thought duble line was no passing
[1:24:29] MinisNeox: in my country its legal
[1:24:32] youngbruffboy: ehh technically that shouldn't be a double yellow
[1:24:41] SkeletonDiver: Thought he said you could go to traffic court

[2:36:56] JWM0420: @idsertian I think that charge was used as a way to punish brandishing but now brandishing is a charge so all Criminal uses of firearms have a codified charge if that makes sense

[5:04:27] GudderSnipe: the old people might be part of their union "protection"
[5:04:49] graua: always scummy to "go after" elderly or vulnerable peepz, a nono
[5:04:58] Soraffe: there is RPing a gang member and then there is constant shitlord and grieving players while saying "That's what my character would do", majority of these "gang members" have no idea how actual gangs operate.
[5:05:36] graua: "Johnnyboy" MmmHmm TeaTime

[5:10:41] hippapossumous: did they leave the dude on the roof?
[5:10:58] K0D3R_: @hippapossumous no
[5:10:58] CptMagicMan: @Soraffe Although in a RP server I agree. In real life gangs do very much hurt people for no fucking reason other than power dynamic and control. That's why they are gangs and not organized crime. They are too unorganized for RICO cases most of the time
[5:11:27] hippapossumous: @K0D3R_ ok good lol
[5:11:43] lockedheart7: holy shit, the street light at the dmv didn't fall down!
[5:12:00] Soraffe: @CptMagicMan Oh of course but the shitlording I see on here is like, it's failure of knowledge on how to roleplay that's been overlooked. Most gang members are min-maxers who treat it as an MMORPG rather than a RP server
[5:12:22] Soraffe: That I've seen
[5:12:44] gvwolf: RIP Sparky Sadge
[5:12:58] CptMagicMan: @Soraffe That's what I meant by for a RP server. But claiming they don't understand gangs operate isn't correct. They are just shitheads. Shitheads will use any excuse to be shitty

[5:19:06] Alofoxx: huh
[5:19:10] tokinsmurf: w-wha
[5:19:18] AntleredCormorant: @CptMagicMan Prefer RP gangs in conflict with other gangs or crim orgs. There's also an expectation IMO to give more than you take overall. Like OK steal a wallet, drugs, valuables or a specific item but you dont pocket wipe and down somebody at random.  Make it scary or funny, give some RP in return, don't just lootbox ppl then down them for the memory wipe, its chickenshit.

[5:20:32] AndyAndyXD: Those dildo!!
[5:20:56] CptMagicMan: @AntleredCormorant I fully agree. But gangs in real life do that shit. They don't understand how to RP. It's not a lack of understanding of how shitty gangs can behave in real life. Like I said, shitheads will use any excuse to be shitty. Like, "being in a gang"
[5:21:04] dreamsofbunnies: At least he's aware of it lol
[5:21:05] TwitchTweaker: Keep the noise down fellas

[5:23:20] CptMagicMan: @AntleredCormorant Exaclty. It's someone who truly doesn't know how to RP in general. Or they are just complete shitheads
[5:23:26] bladedge28: they gottaa fix that bug
[5:23:30] JWM0420: the doors falling off was a bit of a vibe killer

[5:24:22] AntleredCormorant: @CptMagicMan Yup, ppl using the lack of game mechanics as an excuse instead of showing some creativity
[5:24:26] JWM0420: i kind of appreciate Moon being offline occasionally. it's pretty cool
[5:24:41] JWM0420: like he is just doing Roleplay, no distractions
[5:24:42] BonafidepirateFPV: I just looked, he's been streaming about 30 seconds longer than you lol
[5:25:00] carcool12: if I were a streamer and playing offline I would be recording just in case sometimes happens the audience would want to see
[5:25:23] carcool12: delete after every session sort of deal

[6:17:00] K0D3R_: @BallForceOne 15th
[6:17:08] lockedheart7: the vast majority of the lights don't make sense. the cops trying to apply real traffic laws to the game world is silly with how badly its set up for it
[6:17:09] J_Wedge: 15th
[6:17:14] JWM0420: they didn't build the traffic and lights around people being functionally able to follow the law
[6:17:16] carcool12: if there was one celebrity or figure you would want to bring over to onx, and show an ideal day of RP to who would it be?

[6:20:06] JWM0420: @carcool12 I honestly would not be shocked to learn that he just does this in his free time already
[6:20:15] K0D3R_: Beedle the Bardcore if you are interested in it @hippapossumous
[6:20:29] fatbot2004: And if you don't believe that please go back and listen to that 🤬
[6:20:36] hippapossumous: i like just guessing the songs lol
[6:20:39] JWM0420: @carcool12 but maybe not. like he acts as a job, so how fun is doing acting but for free ya know?
[6:20:47] lockedheart7: could withdrawl a few singles to see how the meters work while your here
[6:20:54] hippapossumous: @K0D3R_ thanks

[6:21:33] GudderSnipe: @hippapossumous kanye's wild
[6:22:02] JWM0420: @k0d3r_ yeah but that said they see sillier situations in RP... like there is differences. Cavill is in pretend situations already
[6:22:07] J_Wedge: And minus 500 for Steele and the food for the boss
[6:22:11] lockedheart7: and a really gross hotel room
[6:22:12] hippapossumous: @GudderSnipe i dunno why i thought kanye lol
[6:22:17] 5tolen: 5k is just one hand of poker monkaHmm
[6:22:20] fatbot2004: Davis is not down bad
[6:22:22] JWM0420: and like he gets millions to do that versus like middle income
[6:22:43] carcool12: @jwm0420 truuue maybe a comedian instead? I’m partial to a lot of British comedians, I think someone like James Acaster would be just volitile enough
[6:22:46] K0D3R_: @JWM0420 Cops do cop things != actors not doing acting things? lolwut
[6:23:03] GudderSnipe: did you turn in that cash geo gave you?
[6:23:09] 5tolen: contact abdul the yellow flash :tf:
[6:23:35] carcool12: @k0d3r_ were discussing which celebrity or figure we’d want to play on onx and have an ideal day of rp
[6:23:41] Devenw30: what’s the shit on the bottom right of the screen
[6:23:41] BlunderedHope: shit I loved that game
[6:23:41] fatbot2004: Can't believe Biggs married another guy today

[6:24:11] HippyCowboy: forsenPls forsenPls forsenPls
[6:24:15] graua: Bedge
[6:24:16] K0D3R_: @carcool12 I know, my point to his response was IRL cops play RP cops, how is that different than an actor playing a fictional RP character?
[6:24:23] graua: not on cam
[6:24:23] Skywalkermay: ziggy bum
[6:24:26] fatbot2004: And some guy name razor I think

[6:24:48] Devenw30: @carcool12 I couldn’t tell what it was at first I was truly asking
[6:24:50] fatbot2004: Sorry we were talking about cop RP
[6:24:51] hippapossumous: @fatbot2004 he officiated it you mean?
[6:25:28] hippapossumous: i found my fast and the furious soundtrack cd a week or so ago and its fire
[6:25:36] carcool12: man little dude is definitely wiped out
[6:25:46] JWM0420: @carcool12 I like james
[6:25:48] graua: funny enough the granger looks like the SUV you would PIMP the fk out in the game with chrome spinners and all that jazz
[6:26:15] gvwolf: @hippapossumous I found the second one it was too fast too furious NODDERS
[6:26:26] GreyGryphon: its been so fun watching Davis organically just getting shit done from scratch
[6:26:28] JWM0420: Sentry, question... do you feel like at somepoint you'll roll a second character or you chilling with Davis until his story closes
[6:26:54] matthewmc90: "The Union/Solidarity Set me free with a bullet and a gun" Rancid from Lets Go
[6:26:57] JWM0420: I'm not sure if this server economy makes rolling multiples feasible
[6:27:07] JWM0420: I know that's a struggle on most servers
[6:28:26] gvwolf: glzJAM
[6:28:37] Hanglow365: Joe fudge and bananaduck have been playing a shitload of characters, so has kyle so it's perfectly feasible

[6:36:22] gvwolf: @JWM0420 here try these ... Binoculous
[6:36:34] matthewmc90: Silent when you and Charlie visit Germany you're going to love Munich and the 2 times a day that Cows go from 1 side of the pastures walking through traffic to the other Pasture at night. It was amazing and hilarious to see at the same time.
[6:37:41] FleepOG: its their road
[6:37:43] JWM0420: Cows are kept chained up so they don't grow muscle so the meat is tender
[6:38:00] K0D3R_: Coming from cow country, they definitely do even if you don't see them do it LUL
[6:38:02] JWM0420: south park thing.... veal episode
[6:38:21] matthewmc90: It's traditional there the Germans stop traffic and let the cows move from one side of the city to the other and they are well behaved too. It's been done that way for at least 1000yrs.
[6:41:40] K0D3R_: Did you ever move those 25 "ziti" ?
