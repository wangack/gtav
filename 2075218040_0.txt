[0:28:28] Weedz420: All the cops and civs hate her
[0:28:29] Pantherion: not for her
[0:28:32] mizkifsrecedinghairline: She's hated by 95% of the city.
[0:28:35] AnusReaktorMan: https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyOriginalWolfMVGame-QjkLkBKDvLxPlQ3U
[0:28:35] Frozen_Tundras: The treason thing won't matter if they can pin an evidence tampering charge on her
[0:28:35] twilightbaseballscene: i think this arc for ruth would’ve been amazing if she had someone to push back, until now she didn’t have anyone to keep her in line
[0:28:39] khlaah: I dunno there's a lot of "evidence" they can and will use to get her fired, all they need is a felony
[0:28:40] Janman88: dont think she saw what case she would open up when that court is held
[0:28:40] Jitheneccl: @MaverickAA2100 What happened last night?
[0:28:41] Kayklip: she gone gone RIPBOZO
[0:28:46] slight621: If Ruth goes, and everyone comes together to save the RP yes
[0:28:51] Cheexur: wait Ruth suspended herself?
[0:28:52] chaosKahn: her job definitely not
[0:28:56] BlazeAndConfuse: @rhaziaa wait, she's gonna statue of limitations it?
[0:28:58] AnusReaktorMan: She's gone after that murder case push
[0:29:00] MaverickAA2100: Cornwood happend
[0:29:00] intoxicologistt: damn the RP last night with cornwood and slacks was awsome as fuck
[0:29:01] Carbonitex: When does Ruth actually play
[0:29:02] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/EagerToughLaptopHeyGirl-m4hsiemFU4QZtxwC
[0:29:04] Mystikalrush: Maybe she's looking for an out lol. Every time they meet IRL she has to attend to her new born and can hear them in the mic.
[0:29:04] Bosweny: it’s so fucked they forced cornwood into this weird corruption RP against the PD
[0:29:07] dharentk: they arent gonna charge her for an insult
[0:29:08] tyle_wolf: Bruh all 3 captains are under fire with all this
[0:29:09] kieran347: she will never get chief
[0:29:11] zomgeo: the character Ruth has her own morals and isn’t gonna change how she acts or makes her decisions based on anybody else
[0:29:20] HaVokkv: is she RPing all this stuff on purpose or is she just dumb or w/e?
[0:29:21] kieran347: mayor wing allow it
[0:29:22] miketwng: the problem doesn't end with Ruth. She has an entire team behind her that will further her agenda
[0:29:23] RexPappa: Hey man, how you doing. Yesterday was wild
[0:29:24] Lala61991: wait until you see the clips and hear how ooc upset Esfand was, not cornwood, Esfand
[0:29:26] kieran347: won’t
[0:29:28] SecretChiley: @HaVokkv She knows what she is doing
[0:29:30] gobbagooey: It wasn't just Ruth though, Slacks kinda dropped the ball too
[0:29:30] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettyHealthyUdonPastaThat-JNb1vmLqG90Yv-2z
[0:29:31] rhaziaa: @BlazeAndConfuse Not really sure.  tbh I can't even tell if it's RP anymore or the person behind the screen.  She said it on Ssaab's stream right after they got done talking w/ Cornwood last night.
[0:29:35] RyinTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/ramee/clip/NeighborlySarcasticTubersAliens-FrGA64t9cNL4mJXC
[0:29:36] FatezUwU: it was a joke your honor
[0:29:39] audy: @HaVokkv lol get help
[0:29:47] slight621: Bust Ruth down to have to go through academy again... and demote Slacks to be her CO
[0:29:48] PacGamer: It's salvageable if they make a sudden change with the characters but otherwise they fucked up the direction
[0:29:52] khlaah: i mean it's either Ruth or Cornwood, I feel Cornwood pulls through. Mayor is against Ruth, so I mean, you kinda know where that's going to go.
[0:29:52] Clivent: Podcast - Morning Coffee With Dean
[0:29:54] SecretChiley: They are trying to find more evidence about it
[0:29:54] Mystikalrush: Fire Ruth, fuck slacks, marry Turner.
[0:29:55] TheVirrin: @FatezUwU It was just a prank bro KEKW
[0:29:56] Landoram: Either SBS is a thing or it isn't
[0:29:57] tyler__96: She can be placed on hold until the court case if they take her to court
[0:29:58] dan1shb: Treason is a HUT no?
[0:30:00] condor2104: No lawyers for her defense lol
[0:30:03] Lala61991: True
[0:30:04] orange51611: its a stretch tbh, most likely outcome is that the mayor will get her fired
[0:30:07] MDM4ever1986HD: https://clips.twitch.tv/OriginalClearSrirachaLeeroyJenkins-EguzWN-iv39KuGQp
[0:30:12] taffletv: max is gonna loose his shit no matter what is said

[0:30:21] audy: too many people conflating cheever with Ruth
[0:30:22] miketwng: mhm
[0:30:36] myooo: The fact no lawyer wants to take prosecution says a loy about cornwood case
[0:30:37] Zedowel: Ruth screwed Turner and Slacks
[0:30:42] Cheexur: no
[0:30:42] Kayklip: All for one and Lie for all
[0:30:46] wellbigsmoke: all the cpts bar slacks shit scared of confrontation
[0:30:47] rhaziaa: Slacks doesn't lie, he just gets misinformed tbh.
[0:30:47] Lala61991: feel like easiest was out is a crim perma’s her
[0:30:49] Fossabot: If your enjoying the stream smash the DAMN follow button! I mean shit its just a click away... Might see your name on screen ;)
[0:30:50] miketwng: turner is a bad liar anyway
[0:30:51] kissahomie69x: they have too, otherwise they guilty aswell
[0:30:51] pathasahat: slacks will bend the truth
[0:30:52] Lala61991: way*
[0:30:53] khlaah: Remember, it's not just Treason, there are lesser charges too.
[0:30:53] kieran347: she said should we overthrow the mayor or government I forget which
[0:30:55] Janman88: turner so far did not help much, more so bc he wasnt around much
[0:30:57] AsuniRS: nahh slacks redemption arc inc

[0:31:04] steve_more: Agreed, slacks already lied like fuck several times on the stand, so makes sense
[0:31:04] FunChatt: Not sure about that
[0:31:04] PacGamer: In classic Slacks he'll lie by ommision
[0:31:04] samjack007007: is Dean a brokie?
[0:31:04] chaosKahn: they have to worry about the malicious prosecution and witch hunting also
[0:31:06] waystrider: Turner doesn't even know what's going on
[0:31:07] slight621: They need to plan for the next Mayor as well - Make it a three way race, Cornwood, Mr. K and Chatterbox... because it would be funny
[0:31:07] Lala61991: true slacks just is a pushover
[0:31:07] getanime: No all captains back each other no matter what
[0:31:08] Majopa22: Since no wants to prosecute - is it gonna be Crane???
[0:31:10] twilightbaseballscene: turner has gone along with it so far idk
[0:31:10] wellbigsmoke: @rhaziaa he lied last night saying they all voted for it when he voted not to push it

[0:31:30] pathasahat: @kieran347 she said the should vote out the council
[0:31:31] otgfacial: If Turner tells the truth, won't he be held to the accountability of accessory?
[0:31:31] akonv3: not with the homie

[0:31:33] pacmanslostcousin: hey i live in switzerland was i there

[0:31:35] Janman88: i feel having 3 caps and only one of them is really there to deal with shit, its kinda unfair for slacks to have so much going
[0:31:36] GreatDane_92: thats awesome
[0:31:38] akonv3: homies*
[0:31:38] TheCombatantWombat: Both captains will tell the truth 100% but they will still try to defend her and say she wasn't serious
[0:31:38] MokuZz_: Today is geneva auto show
[0:31:39] quaylewastaken: Slack will gaslight the fuck outta you
[0:31:42] rhaziaa: @wellbigsmoke Fair point lol, but he's taking the heat to try and keep it off others.  Not sure if it's a malicious lie, or him being a "leader"
[0:31:42] Pantherion: turner is the other captain who suggested taking over LUL he aint telling the truth
[0:31:44] Zealzeal: The whole Town will show up to the court when the court is happening

[0:32:56] Haffsack: https://clips.twitch.tv/FamousSlipperyKangarooNotATK-EXUpFdPPQlBnezCh
[0:32:58] jwou11: Ruth stirs shit up then goes to sleep and Slacks is left having to deal with it all

[0:34:10] SecretChiley: @LogicWeasel Like cornwood said, they lit the fire, but didn't know how flammable it was
[0:34:10] intoxicologistt: cornwood was cornered, did they expect a different reaction from him , he did good he stood his ground , and i fucjing loved the way he shouted outside PD :D
[0:34:12] bosschar95: i dont think he would of got the chance to join again if den talked shit
[0:34:13] Zedowel: Imagine if Den somehow talked to the mayor about working in the PD haha

[0:34:22] chapoop_: @deansocool my fav part was when the captains said they not trying to make examples out of anybody and then when u got fired they said the opposite
[0:34:23] kieran347: the captain’s position are under scrutiny so heads could role
[0:34:24] LogicWeasel: @SecretChiley esfandW gotta let em know
[0:34:25] AsuniRS: anyone who tought it was paranoia after you caught ruth spying on you is crazy
[0:34:29] catfish_quackenbush: @LogicWeasel Does Den know about all this, i just logged on to stream so may have missed him talking
[0:34:32] 101toad: Will harm the city beyond repair duckass
[0:34:33] MoistMouthMags: @Deansocool would denzel testify against ruth if they wanted to bring up the spying stuff in sandy?
[0:34:35] zomgeo: seems like the decision to fire you was made before you even entered your review whereas judgements are being made after cornwoods review
[0:34:36] Mo0seJockey: Bro cirnwood went off last night was epic
[0:34:37] bdg_deansofish: That's why you go to the mayor he's been looking for ammo
[0:34:37] Lala61991: Blackwell came to complain to slacks about shift 1 seniors and captains and he dapped her
[0:34:37] Scully_18: How badass did Cornwood look in his suit
[0:34:43] MrSirDudeGuyBro: @chapoop_ truee
[0:34:43] kunkunkivet: FREE DENZEL & CLETUS
[0:34:47] twilightbaseballscene: that’s why den being in the middle of the stuff with the mayor would be so juicy he has so much insight
[0:34:50] akonv3: true
[0:34:54] johnmalkovich95: true
[0:34:55] Clivent: they fired you to make an example out of you NODDERS

[0:34:59] Emeralblade: And the funny thing is, its almost like 0 civs seem to be on the side of police in all this. Just puts things in perspective
[0:35:01] LogicWeasel: @catfish_quackenbush I also just got here, so I'm eager to see what Dean knows.
[0:35:03] kieran347: mayor hates Ruth
[0:35:05] mizkifsrecedinghairline: The PD would have had such a different vibe if they put half as much effort into praising officers for outstanding work as they do nitpicking.
[0:35:06] kissahomie69x: u realllyy should talk on Den with the Mayor
[0:35:07] uploadfile: 1. don't join chases 2. if you do, don't pit even if ordered to 3. don't speak to anyone unless spoken to you won't get fired again, take the fun out of RP
[0:35:09] kiko1o2: i cant wait to see what today brings

[0:35:17] atdiamonds: tbf all this coming out has defo proven that denzel wasn’t paranoid
[0:35:20] Shane_Martin1992: Slacks tried killing Aziz in the hospital
[0:35:22] Scully_18: @kieran347 everyone does to be fair now lol
[0:35:25] kieran347: he thinks all 3 of the captains are useless
[0:35:26] Janman88: also bc of what? cause u guys hope LASO comes?
[0:35:29] akonv3: even aziz got smoke for no reason
[0:35:30] Clivent: I WANT MORE ADS DESKCHAN

[0:35:47] sokobian: DenZel will come back and walk slower than ever
[0:35:51] MoistMouthMags: true colors are out now....nobody wants the current HC
[0:35:54] skumskilla: max wants it to pretty much
[0:35:57] mizkifsrecedinghairline: it just sucks that Slacks and Turner are going to end up getting sacrificed along with Ruth.
[0:35:59] audy: no shot sounds like a movie LUL

[0:38:57] kieran347: when the mayor was shouting at the captains was funney
[0:38:58] Janman88: i think the last straw was that no snr in the interest of cornwood was present at the review
[0:39:00] omg_hi_friend: Ruth needs ta go
[0:39:01] kiko1o2: i love how Ruths whole thing is like people lost faith in old pd and govt collasped and shes here to help make that not happen but she like single handed did the opposite
[0:39:02] SpiceWeaseI: @bdg_deansofish why would he want to can't ve a lawyer or a cop because they decided to go hard as fuck on some lighthearted sbs

[0:42:39] khlaah: I feel Cornwood is 100% done with the PD and will do something different, Sherriff most likely, something that he feels will help Los Santos and the people
[0:42:42] sendemup: i mean not trying to do the whole real life = rp thing but police officers get charged for way less

If you look at the officers who have NOT been having routine issues with captains, what they all have in common is that they are SINGLE-SHIFT-ONLY or less workers.

[3:00:43] brinderwalt42: @Deansocool It's specifically the cross-shift officers (coincidentally also the ones inclined to pursue longterm investigations) who have been having major issues with high command. Because their persistence on duty over time creates a workforce dynamic OUTSIDE of the captains' direct influence - inherently undermining their authority in terms of workforce dynamics.

As things stand, PD's high command is afk and needs to be started over from scratch.

[3:01:04] azi_guren: The root problem of PD right there. The 3 captains disciplining everybody in PD, but nobody to discipline them for their mistakes. Nobody else in PD can voice even an opinion against them without some sort of repercussion to their career. All 3 captains back each other up from their mistakes or weaknesses, while never improving themselves or taking accountability for their actions. These 3 captains are using DAPs as a weapon to ensure nobody complains about the PD structure and every tiny mistak

[7:10:54] retrost1: suspended ruth probably outside the garage
[7:10:59] DanLGG: @twitchprimeis4free I was thinking the same thing. She could be Passout3 around a corner anywhere recording
[7:11:08] m4l1kkk: The Captains backseat the officers on the ground 😭

[7:13:08] xGotNoClout: @Cheexur I am high af and legit though this was Ruth LUL
[7:13:11] SoloRoca: @reyreylerey A Sheriff oversees the whole county and a police department oversees a city
[7:13:14] bosschar95: slacks should get fired tho

[7:13:41] BoJackJohnsson: For the shit he did last night with the lawyer hes going to be demoted at least
[7:13:43] lumpspaceprince: and he thinks cornwood is being manipulated
[7:13:44] tyler__96: I like slacks but he doesn't have a backbone to stand up for himself
[7:13:52] atdiamonds: nahhhh slacks on some bs
[7:13:52] m4l1kkk: If Den heard yesterday's argument 😂
[7:13:53] itsRickus: The only way slacks makes it is if he speaks the truth in court and says they've talked about treason and not following command.
[7:14:00] Jethrq: 26 hours is crazy
[7:14:01] SoloRoca: If Max gets his way he is firing all the captains
[7:14:02] PeterPleb1992: slacks keep talking about integrity and standards but chooses when to abide by them, thats not captain material lol
[7:14:03] RevethyTV: so much shit happening everywhere
[7:14:08] KingDaveIII: if he has been manipulated surely he should be fired for incompetence?

[7:56:29] hoanzlgoas: @PeterPleb1992 yeah lynch could only fail but dune is one of the few movies where i think thought narration works and should be done. In the books its also soo much "thinking" . in Dune you are kind of forced to thought narration to get this giant ammount of meta info to the viewer. The new movies made a lot with visual, but if you didnt read the books they just go over your head
[7:56:29] BDG_Toa676: @longdongsilverrr13 @fossabot

[7:57:16] theblackdog808: ( Kappa)
[7:57:17] PeterPleb1992: @hoanzlgoas dont get me wrong, the narration didnt  bother me at all, the ending is kinda way off but other than that nothing really bothered me
[7:57:17] MDM4ever1986HD: loooks so dope
[7:57:32] MDM4ever1986HD: Austin Butler is unrecognizable

[7:57:47] red_eyed_jed1: the only thing den asked for was to reserve 111 callsign, that was bullshit to deny that

[7:59:41] hoanzlgoas: @PeterPleb1992 yeah the lynch movies ending is a bad compromise, they had to find something that is somewhat of an end because they new they would not make a sequel, also lot fell of the cutting table. Also Cinema in the 80s in regards of complex stories was a lot different than today

[8:36:14] Milo_lul: If it was up to Slacks Cornwood would've been unsuspended but demoted and back on duty yesterday, Ruth pulled the 'send to jail' card to stop it from happening, Turner set a deadline of 24 hours for a decision (which couldn't be made without clearing him of potential charges) now Ruth who blocked the rehiring has suspended herself and Slacks is about to be hit with a malicious prosecution charge, the dominos are falling into place exactly how Dean planned when he created Donald Bush XXIII
