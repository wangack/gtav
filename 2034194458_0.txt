[1:06:59] LJinX__: @arcticanomaly oh shit
[1:07:02] SnowLae: In the US, you pay higher taxes every year on electric cars because they don't get the money from gas taxes. They always get their money one way or another
[1:07:05] Quru: spend more, pay taxes and don't ask questions
[1:07:05] crispysnowball: I see both positives and negatives in moving away from cash, mainly i have spent years in retail and moving away from cash really lowers the risk of getting robbed
[1:07:20] verticalmbp: but during the 1600, the BoE and others promised more money to people than was available (or something like that)

[2:12:34] Nealee: in Pests " state of Tarkkov" video about 7 mins in hee shows how you can see the playeer name in the console
[2:12:44] DrCached: @chat it's not about playing the game these people want to sell the items on Ebay
[2:12:47] azmer1987: Wild. I should sell a came thats completely done. Log in with every item. The end
[2:12:50] JBarlak: @zechss_  I don’t like when chat dad fights uhsBLESS

[2:12:56] azmer1987: Game *
[2:12:56] BluGiant: Zechs TeaTime  󠀀
[2:12:59] Thrillyard: they pull it off the map than actively grab the null valued items
[2:12:59] notched_: That sounds do fun haha I don't get it so weird. I've started a new character GTAO because I had too much money and I was no longer having fun
[2:12:59] Zechss_: @JBarlak i will ban you to
[2:13:06] ScootDootGoop: Well that  sucks  :/
[2:13:22] SaintjimmyTV: They probably make their money from selling it for real money
[2:13:26] DrCached: YEP They sell the items and make $$$$
[2:13:27] brain20_: i don't get how its fun to just get all the stuff for free
[2:13:27] KeeneyHD: Because they make real money from cheating.
[2:13:29] Zechss_: cheating doesnt compute to me regardless
[2:13:30] GermanBacon: to make more money
[2:13:30] Gramulk: That takes the enjoyment out of playing any game.
[2:13:35] Darthbobo77: they make cash from it . selling the stuff
[2:13:35] Locus92: some people get a thrill out of cheating weirdly
[2:13:36] DamoclesDC: At least with tarkov it's all about RMT
[2:13:36] Trawls421: Gameshark
[2:13:38] Fanjecture: i used to have Game Genie for NES when I was a kid... but I was a kid

[2:13:42] DrCached: YEP RMT
[2:13:44] Zechss_: theres no satisfaction in winning when you cheated to do it
[2:13:49] ChaosChild: for all I care, both developers and users of cheats can all die... in game KappaRoss
[2:13:50] Shadyslim: the only thing that makes since is paying the 350 for cheats and then selling the rubles for RL money
[2:13:55] ExCodix: LUL
[2:13:55] Rabid_Symptoms: Shabba!!
[2:13:57] RealGasoline: CLARA?!?!?!

[2:14:15] Goldf0xX: sims
[2:14:16] JBarlak: @fanjecture I was always scared I would do something back to my system if I used it lol
[2:14:18] Markzie: BSG doesn't even have anti-cheat, they rely on player reports
[2:14:18] mister_wrecked: Unless you're enjoyment comes from griefing other players I don't get it either. If they are playing to grief people I can at least get it even though it makes them an asshole.
[2:14:20] GermanBacon: classic
[2:14:20] PierceDev: It's even funnier when they play like dogshit and die
[2:14:20] Tarchomper: games are expensive and then to pay on top just to win i can't understand why
[2:14:21] lord_dragox412: classic

[2:14:40] RealGasoline: the people that get baited to open their task manager
[2:14:40] notched_: I guess I can at least see a benefit to it as a streamer
[2:14:48] Bakemaan: @uhSnow they have monitors now with AI that detects enemies and learns the games as you play them, MSI brought them out.
[2:14:50] sLozzL: shows why they need to cheat in the first place
[2:14:51] Fanjecture: dont cheat in video games. only Taxes Kapp

[2:17:22] Frex747: Got AI built into the monitor so it cant be detected
[2:17:23] bobfancy: its completely in the monitor, impossible for devs to see it
[2:17:27] aVertigo91: highlights direction of enemies
[2:17:29] Bakemaan: and it learns as you play
[2:17:29] Shadyslim: yeah like the screen does it not a progarm on the pc
[2:17:32] ScootDootGoop: Clap
[2:17:35] gimpling_: looking at the minimap, but can be trained to detect anything
[2:17:43] Rozonus: so like hardware crosshairs 2.0?
[2:17:44] gimpling_: no
[2:17:46] azmer1987: Its wild i had this conversation yesterday, the amount of money in game/steaming that their must be undetectable very subtle assists

[2:18:07] Darthbobo77: its on onscreen tracking from the display . you cant see it if you do nmot look at the screen
[2:18:10] SirHellsing1995: kyliebAww
[2:18:11] mister_wrecked: All this stuff is big business. People are actually buying DMA hardware cheats and second PCs to run AI cheats. Folks will pay $1000+ for a DMA card these days so they can safely cheati n CoD.
[2:18:18] ChaosChild: no, imagine in league of legends AI tracks your minimap 100% of the time and flashes red when enemy is coming towards you
[2:18:27] keeperofscams: i believe that MSI AI monitor is used in League of Legends
[2:18:28] GermanBacon: Nealee about one more hour till she gets up usually
[2:18:30] gimpling_: impossible to tell
[2:18:34] RealGasoline: No
[2:18:34] gimpling_: nope
[2:18:35] Beopuppy85: Not being that guy, but people who play alot do kinda know where the middle of the screen is. Im a cretin and i had a good idea in Tarkov where my centre screen is

[2:18:50] BluGiant: Nerdge 󠀀
[2:18:50] sLozzL: is it like someone using a spot of blue tack but way better because they also highlight the guy?
[2:18:52] ScootDootGoop: LUL
[2:18:52] RealGasoline: You could... the AI Learns LUL
[2:18:53] UnlistedDog: That's how some of the best CS hacks worked, with a webcam watching the screen and AI doing the hard work behind the scenes.
[2:18:54] PierceDev: I wonder if Vanguard anti cheat will pick that up
[2:18:54] Bakemaan: no software
[2:18:55] gimpling_: its from the picture signal, processed by the screen. your pc knows nothing about it
[2:18:55] BluGiant: Nerdge
[2:18:56] Shadyslim: becuase its your screen not a program not running on your desktop
[2:18:58] ninjagirl8816: @amandathecookie happy birthday uhsLove

[2:19:25] ScootDootGoop: You did whaaaaat
[2:19:26] keeperofscams: well, i would ask, what's the point of letting AI play the game for you ... why play at all ?
[2:19:26] StevenB79: but did you tree camp
[2:19:28] Bakemaan: weve all done it
[2:19:31] ScootDootGoop: D:

[2:19:45] RealGasoline: I've been a rat before, IDGAF
[2:19:45] mister_wrecked: There isn't anything wrong with ratting if you are not actually cheating. Its just strats.
[2:19:47] jtmngaming: There is nothing wrong with the way of the rat
[2:19:50] Dtakul: That's why I adore wow rn.. no aim bot can help u do mythic raid or mythic 25+
[2:19:51] sLozzL: do what you gotta do
[2:19:57] Beopuppy85: Ratting is ok when u got shit to do. Extract Camping isnt cool imo
[2:20:00] sLozzL: @PieterVMB probably division
[2:20:00] GermanBacon: if those monitors are actually that powerful, games will just not work when they are attached
[2:20:15] Darthbobo77: listen .. if you get killed by an exfil camper, then its on you .. dont drop your awareness until you are out
[2:20:15] PierceDev: yep
[2:20:22] GermanBacon: Dtakul oh boy do i have news for you KEKL
[2:20:33] Rozonus: the hard knock life of a rat
[2:20:39] skcode: hi
[2:20:45] Dtakul: I mean dbm, weak auras etc are all  "helping" tools but u can't just set "auto play"  on ur char n watch it do it all ;d
[2:20:49] RealGasoline: not suprised
[2:20:53] RealGasoline: fek
[2:20:53] Aaron_TheGod: Yes there are addons that got banned by Blizzard but sometimes there are still some custom made ones out there. And ofc bot clients that can follow a rotation ect
[2:20:54] AnalgesicPM: wasn't there a period of time when DBM specifically told you where to stand?
[2:20:55] MartMonster: damn LUL

[2:21:05] azmer1987: @dtakul wild!
[2:21:08] Rozonus: rat got slapped
[2:21:23] SaintjimmyTV: My Mrs got one tapped by a naked with an SKS. it was upsetting when i proceeded to miss every shot and he killed me too
[2:21:31] GermanBacon: Dtakul there are rotation bots, so you can fully focus one movement. there are PvP bots that get gladiator on multiple classes.
[2:21:45] Darthbobo77: thats broke ppl trying to get a gun lol

[5:41:54] Mordis_: I'm glad I don't have emissions where I am. I did all kinds of crazy shit to my truck.
[5:42:01] JonasInDenmark: God. Remember that Top Gear episode where they had to get insurance KEKW
[5:42:03] Soul_Hero: Then you get charged a ridiculous "admin fee" for changing policy details mid-term!
[5:42:09] SurreyHuntress: kk.
[5:42:12] SurreyHuntress: hmmm. lol.

[5:42:32] Bakemaan: per YR chat

[5:42:45] ironpetke: to get a car insurance in finland you just need to give them the make, model and year with the plate number and yer set
[5:42:48] Rynk1e: Don't the new beamers have a setting for the exhaust valve? You could tweak that to open it all the time right?  Might be an M series thing

[5:44:13] 007Nightfire: men crash more cars, woman have more little damage
[5:44:13] Mordis_: Until you reach a certain age then insurance starts going back up again.
[5:44:21] Christian2920: 25 is where the first bigger drop happens in Denmark, then continuously drops from there
[5:44:24] Christian2920: for males
