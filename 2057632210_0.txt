[4:22:40] KAWSTlC: she was quick to say it was her fault
[4:22:45] KAWSTlC: i assume
[4:23:00] StreamElements:  Check out Silents youtube channel with stream VOD's and Variety games! https://www.youtube.com/@silentvariety
[4:23:04] lucho724_: she was quick to instantly start apologizing and to not be a burden, its the typical response tbh
[4:23:09] Emran__H: too many sorrys seems like she's hiding some feeling
[4:23:11] Mr5pooky: i think miggy saying this really well
[4:23:22] xkayb_: it sounded like nervous word vomit
[4:23:22] JustRickehh: yeah exactly way to many sorrys right away
[4:23:27] SchnitzleKing: proactivity is the key as a new member
[4:23:50] seratodopemine: Apologizing too quickly means she doesn't want you to dig deeper and get on your good side
[4:24:04] Higgle23: if she’s new then her response makes sense trying to get a grip of everyone tbh and when things the first time she is being told this 3 leaders come down on her first instead of smaller talk about it her response to me makes sense imo
[4:24:08] Puk3s: Can you blame her for being nervous
[4:24:25] lucho724_: true, she has the 3 leaders in a private convo a week in, its initmidating
[4:24:35] jaxxhavick: Well not yet.....
[4:24:37] xdSilly: MMMM
[4:24:38] Maxverine: not - 1000 speech? wtfwtfwtf

[4:25:05] absolo_m: wow every leader just said something great at the same time
[4:25:06] lucho724_: i think ppl forget that miggy is actually decent in these talks
[4:25:24] Puk3s: Ya all three saying that made it worse
[4:25:41] lucho724_: imo miggy is better at internal shit, where flippy is better at gang politics outside

[4:27:42] absolo_m: dont know her enough yet but could be right\
[4:27:43] winterskyyyy: mhm
[4:27:45] lucho724_: she just instantly caved
[4:28:00] Puk3s: Part is probably that she wants to be in the group
[4:28:07] lucho724_: she is also talking to her gang leaders, she feels she is supposed to fold
[4:28:09] puhctek: anyone would be nervous in front of the leaders, so she is definitely holding back
[4:28:09] guatemalalibre: Truee
[4:28:15] khaled_5655: swizzmBINO swizzmBINO
[4:28:15] Refanpng: mhm

[4:28:16] lucho724_: this is the warning
[4:28:17] Higgle23: feel like if she put up a fight I’d be more worried imo
[4:28:18] XxGazzaGazxX: i agree time will tell
[4:28:18] mutaint: i think she's eager to please since she's new so she's just taking the feedback without questions
[4:28:18] seratodopemine: This is like vagos hangaround vibes. Can't talk back to jefes and keep apologizing out of nervousness
[4:28:21] Squidmyster: Putting cards on the table
[4:28:25] Abdoullah21: this going well tbh
[4:28:27] lajick: I think she took the last meeting too literal, when said they should get to know everyone

[4:29:17] Puk3s: Ya and that's why maybe ask her individually
[4:29:25] AK_1G: who is she chat ?
[4:29:34] Higgle23: yes early Ash  vibes
[4:29:45] lucho724_: @SussyTaffy addison, she is a new hangaround but very very green
[4:29:55] TwistedHawkz: maybe she should hang out with ash
[4:30:07] TwistedHawkz: and get to know people
[4:30:55] bazzinga420x: NotLikeThis
[4:30:58] AK_1G: @lucho724_ veryCat
[4:31:08] HEGGA: Shitty but needed
[4:31:13] lucho724_: its shitty, but its an opportunity for her to grow
[4:31:22] XxGazzaGazxX: convo was needed and time will tell
[4:31:24] Puk3s: For sure, second smaller group convo makes sense though
[4:31:28] ItzBwo: better now than when it's already at kick rocks status
[4:31:29] lucho724_: its laying all the cards on the table. its both reassurance
[4:31:35] txc_menace: She's new to the city she will learn from you eventually

[4:31:53] Eemelii: ur shitting urself
[4:31:56] Lady_Libra_Gamer: true
[4:32:00] winterskyyyy: yeah

[4:32:17] Fr0stwav3: thats an "oh shit i'm getting watched, gotta keep my head down" scenario KEKW
[4:32:17] puhctek: i think you want a feeling of honesty from her, but she is going for diplomatic answers because of the nerves
[4:32:18] TwistedHawkz: ye same because she thinking she fucked up but shes not really she need to work on getting to know others more
[4:32:19] lightstormclaw: i would be extremely held back in that position
