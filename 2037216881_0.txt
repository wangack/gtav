[2:20:19] AnalgesicPM: I think Jackie will make a great Bond Villain

[2:24:14] Money2Much: in the future u aiming for a high command position
[2:24:17] 222123: I reckon he means that it is more common for people to rely on their "past" than their "new" life
[2:24:19] KappaManJason: I feel like people haven’t really malded yet in 4.0 yet
[2:24:40] GekkoGamingTV: people malding OOC means youre doing something right...
