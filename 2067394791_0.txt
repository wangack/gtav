[5:03:13] tundra_snake: I like blue for fillet, but not other cuts
[5:03:21] Yemillito: is blue steak just straight up not cooked in the middle?
[5:03:24] EmrysorMerlin: I don't like the stuff it served with
[5:03:25] robertsmithjr: @BluGiant carmelized onions if done right are amazing
[5:03:28] Bakemaan: @Yemillito seared thats it
[5:03:37] Christian2920: Pretty much yes tundra_snake
[5:03:38] Yemillito: @bakemaan that’s crazy
[5:03:41] BluGiant: @robertsmithjr Yeah
[5:03:48] StarWhistle517: theres a middle eastern dish thats raw meat thats got spices in it, kibe i think
[5:03:48] robertsmithjr: @VetRaptor oh ouch that sucks man
[5:03:50] Christian2920: Its good for Filet, but I wouldnt order any other cut blue
[5:03:51] tundra_snake: a blue fillet with a nice crust, yum

[5:05:18] EmrysorMerlin: @the_only_tetra pretty much lol
[5:05:26] aliiusthebeard: @Bakemaan raw eggs in EU are safe because we don't wash them, so chance of Salmonella is very low.
[5:05:44] robertsmithjr: @BluGiant my step daughters hated onions, i made caramelized onions to go with dinner i was making and then loved them, but i slow cooked them for like it had to have been a good 2 and a half to 3 hours, just low and slow, letting the flavors develope and them naturally caramelize
[5:05:57] Saleem: albert
[5:06:08] Bakemaan: @robertsmithjr sounds like the start to a good onion soup
[5:06:18] the_only_tetra: saleem Lovegers
[5:06:21] Saleem: help me albert
[5:06:31] EmrysorMerlin: @robertsmithjr I hate onion but hate if it not added to shepherd pie I just then take it out once cooked

[5:07:17] Bakemaan: @Saleem bug report !
[5:07:20] robertsmithjr: @Bakemaan it would have made an awesome onion soup, but i needed a lot more onions, i cooked down 6 onions and by the time they were done caramelizing to the point i wanted them i had maybe a cup, or cup and a half of onions left
[5:07:43] Bakemaan: @robertsmithjr very true, I make onion soup all the time Kreygasm
[5:07:47] robertsmithjr: @EmrysorMerlin so you like the flavor but not texture?
[5:07:57] BluGiant: @robertsmithjr NODDERS nom nom
[5:08:34] MegaTruong: That's a good looking dude
[5:08:38] Bakemaan: so steak tartare i didnt realize was raw ground beef thats crazy
[5:08:55] EmrysorMerlin: @robertsmithjr I hate the flavour of the onion it self but not the flavour it makes mixed if that makes sense

[5:09:15] Bakemaan: @EmrysorMerlin use onion powder?

[5:09:42] EmrysorMerlin: @bakemaan lol I don't cook I just eat
[5:09:45] robertsmithjr: @EmrysorMerlin no it makes perfect sense, you like the way it enhances the other flavors, but not the standalone flavor correct?
[5:09:55] EmrysorMerlin: @robertsmithjr yes
[5:10:15] NealWilliam: Time to go gtg bye
[5:10:43] the_only_tetra: @robertsmithjr i'm same with onion like the flavour and smell but has to be fine chopped
[5:10:50] robertsmithjr: @EmrysorMerlin i wonder if you would like properly caramelized onions, im talking when they are cooked down to long that they end up getting sweet, so good
[5:10:57] the_only_tetra: @NealWilliam have a good day bud
[5:11:22] EmrysorMerlin: @robertsmithjr nope mums tried that
[5:12:02] robertsmithjr: @the_only_tetra i bet you would like the way i make them also, they go from being a strong some times bitter flavor to a deep sweet flavor, and almost look burned but there not

[5:17:35] robertsmithjr: @EmrysorMerlin interesting, for me i love to cook, but i take a long time to make certain dishes, things like pasta sauce, low and slow, even all day slow cooking is the best sauce, you have to give food time for flavors to develope and when they marry as they call it, the flavors just get so much better
