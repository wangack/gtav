[0:13:45] Random_Slacker: yeah kinda just looks in the way, with how little room you got to work with
[0:14:11] PeachTwirl: could do a short counter with fridge and microwave in the corner. that would give you room for a small table next to the deak
[0:14:24] PeachTwirl: *desk
[0:15:19] Random_Slacker: it would be good if they added alternate versions of the pc desk at some point, its so clunky with the stuff on it
