[5:17:19] buttermode: Hoa needs to find other sources of money not just meth.
[5:17:19] Maithiss: Siz has such a large income because he actually does thing and goes out of his way to make money for the sake of RP
[5:17:22] wondervviener: HOA needs to do some southside loyalty training. They help out the group even if they don't get paid.
