[5:15:20] GizmoMCs: its a woman got weak punches only way for her to match was the gun Keepo

[5:15:48] cirCle_faCe: D:
[5:15:53] jack_wumbo: proportionality is from the perspective of the defender. If daisy thought holding a gun was in proportion to the presented danger, then it would clear
[5:15:54] Kemli: civs having a force matrix is bonkers. There's no limits
[5:15:56] Jertzukka: You can just say that hit in the head is deadly

[5:16:03] AzureCatalyst: The Civ Force Matrix is fun
[5:16:05] JoeyDangerouslyHD: he was beatehn unconus right?
[5:16:05] m_Gordon: she brandished the weapon in self defense when her coworker was punched. she didn't use the weapon in self defense until guns were drawn on her. right?
[5:16:05] ttatortots: bbirbSCAM
[5:16:06] xRyab: you could brandish but not shoot

[5:16:23] klaatuNaatu: Just get beat to death Shruge
[5:16:24] captainlucha: you became the aggressor Madge
[5:16:25] goblinpearl: @m_gordon that sounds most right
[5:16:28] Corporeal_Phantom: if she is in fear for her life, everything should be in play, right?
[5:16:29] Weav0ls: It's unreasonable to expect a woman to defend her self in hand to hand combat against 2 men
[5:16:30] Chunko_Muffo: It makes zero sense, after you are struck you are at a disadvantage and going down could be death
[5:16:30] AstroPride: getting attacked with a bat, and you have no bat? RIP bozo
[5:16:32] ElysiumSea: MMA fighter walks up to gun - wielding CHILD who gets arrested
[5:16:32] froggyrl: especially a punch to the back of the head, that’s the easiest way for a punch to turn lethal
[5:16:34] Dooderz: @PENTA you cant, and whatever "precedent" this judge has created can be destroyed by a good ADA LuL
[5:16:34] TheGulagJesus: Also it would be the same for if they were stabbing tusk?
[5:16:35] NomadDee: Once you get hit balance is compromised, there's no "matching"

[5:16:43] narvahhh: Doesnt that mean that the first one to start throwing punches will always win LUL
[5:16:43] NOPEWALK: the judge never said "match force" he just said it had to be proportional, it's not the same thing
[5:16:44] testicle_torsion: ON WOMANS MONTH
[5:16:46] pumpconnoisseur: force matching isn't a thing with self defence, either you fear for your life or you don't
[5:16:47] misterbean600: good thing tusk hasnt made it back
[5:16:47] KillerBanshee: bruh getting knocked out could be lethal in so many ways
[5:16:49] BanyTV: couldnt it also be if she thought her friend was going to die so she pulled her gun to proportionately kill the people killing her friend?
[5:16:50] Drivont: try punching a cop and see what level of force they respond with

[7:09:12] THRAX_o7: even if you just shoot into the air
[7:09:13] The_Jkal: if you dont use it - you lose it
[7:09:13] kingofakina: plus daisy said "to step away"
[7:09:13] BobRossSaladToss: monkaGIGA
[7:09:13] KLR_Adventure: yes
[7:09:13] Smierce: I feel like Joy has ruled the exact opposite for a Jordan trial
[7:09:13] Onyxdevil: you do have to retreat tho
[7:09:13] Cory1750: in an active fight yeah
[7:09:14] LockeLam: the rest are stand your ground
[7:09:14] ShrimpCommander: Clap 1 side to story

[7:09:15] fatpaulie91: There is no duty to retreat here.
[7:09:15] bubblyrug: Oh man I hope these guys don't steal my gun and shoot me in the head after they knock me out
[7:09:16] saintdeath97: police can go 1 level higher
[7:09:16] Tzazi: Chekov's self defense
[7:09:16] odaidai: If you fear for you life yes you use it.
[7:09:16] CLERIKX: its never for show
[7:09:16] RSMatticus: NEVER AIM A GUN AT SOMETHING YOU DON"T ATTEND TO SHOT
[7:09:17] NomadDee: Can that be appealed so Katya can change it.
[7:09:17] BanyTV: They also admitted they kicked Daisy while she was down, which means they wanted to kill her, so she was right to pull the gun
[7:09:18] Kemli: Then why is brandishing a charge. Wait.
[7:09:18] noppels: so how is a 130lbs woman supposed to defend themselves against a 220 lbs guy
[7:09:18] mattinreality: Plus ONX doesnt have a duty to retreat
[7:09:18] cssko_: this is terrible advice do not listen to this
[7:09:18] SpencerLulz: thats why you dont pull it out over a sucker punch
[7:09:19] JustForGrins_: these people never heard of the rittenhouse case KEKW he won that shit
[7:09:19] fernz__: absolutely true
[7:09:19] GrizBearington: Don't aim at anything you don't intend to destroy.
[7:09:19] asleepycamper: hold on, let me load my hand musket
[7:09:20] fuuhhzz: if you are in fear for your life, you use that shit
[7:09:20] Crowhav3n: @PENTA nah bro hes the judge playing a role let him makes the rules from what some dumbass said
[7:09:20] TheFury88: nah it basically that way in Massachusetts in mass if someone is beating you up your better off beating up yourself than defending yourself
[7:09:20] kingjacoblear: 100%
[7:09:20] zuranotkatsura: If someone is jumping you you don't just be like oh ill fist fight these guys wtf
[7:09:20] freedomboy696969: communists malding
[7:09:21] Qwaz: you do have a duty to retreat tho

[7:09:22] GreatAmericanTotalEclipse: Eggplant
[7:09:22] kanzler1871: pepoYELL I AM ANNOUNCING THE PRESENCE OF MY FIREARMS PLEASE STOP PUNCHING ME pepeYELL
[7:09:23] Lawlcat: Maine there is
[7:09:23] SturmSauer: England is making people register knives
[7:09:23] Lancelapin: so in your mind it's ok to kill someone because he assulted you ?
[7:09:24] teachj: and if you shoot, you shoot to kill.
[7:09:25] thepoyeet: EU brain actually scares me how u think that gonna help at all
[7:09:25] chawarma93: oi mate
[7:09:26] omniplex924: New Jersey
[7:09:26] Qwaz: yes there is KEKW
[7:09:26] dtekc: i think the fact he thought you were insane i was sitting here like what
[7:09:27] narvahhh: Like if you attack a cop he is going to shoot you KEKW
[7:09:27] rapter29: @Onyxdevil not in stand your ground states
[7:09:27] cringex69: exactly where daisy messed up, she didn't shoot immediately after drawing
[7:09:28] anextremeemo: someone might pull your card one day
[7:09:28] Myndbug: european laws aren't written with the idea that civilians have firearms so yes @PENTA
[7:09:28] last_user_name_banned: sorry little timmy i pulled it out
[7:09:29] fuuhhzz: no warning shots either
[7:09:29] Athorith: Not if you're getting attacked
[7:09:29] i_am_beardman: there is no duty to retreat in this state
[7:09:30] mackfitzg: sounds like something you should bring up now that you have power in the government
[7:09:30] Evanesque: I tell men the same thing. Don't pull it out if I can't use it? Shruge
[7:09:30] exhume125: Not even California
[7:09:31] YrX_: Only for stand your ground states I think..
[7:09:31] yoDeRock: BRITS YOU MEAN LIBS
[7:09:31] Clucky206: based and true from Penta
[7:09:31] Zefalon: @Qwaz thats wrong
[7:09:31] Modivonglad: NJ there is
[7:09:32] avarice176: Only draw if you are in fear for your life. If you are drawing, you're shooting
[7:09:32] WaterChampsoowoo: shit can go so sideways if you pull one out without the intent to use
[7:09:32] Lawlcat: I believe Maine and Rhode Island are both duty to retreat
[7:09:33] NOPEWALK: ok that's not true
[7:09:33] Maverick_Money: this is some British anti freedom proprapanda
[7:09:33] ayyfamo: in the US you can't just attack people and expect to not get shot
[7:09:33] 0ctember: That's not what they mean when they say that. They say that as a caution not to pull your gun out unless it's actually reallly necessary
[7:09:34] Bpapman: literally no instructor would teach that. The gun is the ultimate deterant. You don't need to shoot on top unless they continue
[7:09:35] JackDanylz: I remember Milton saying this was wild from Canada. Having to match force for force
[7:09:35] sterowentUS: the physical threat + force + intent to harm you critically is enough reason to use deadly force
[7:09:36] ClappedCheek: Cali is different
[7:09:37] zaszthebistro: server side i dont think they want guns everytime a punch happens @PENTA also i agree with all the rest you said
[7:09:37] Filikeu: @penta didn't recently a school girl died because of a altercation brain injury  in USA
[7:09:37] Kinghaye1: I think Joy has it right alot of the time. But this situation started with the guys threatening to attack them how could the aggressors argue self defense
[7:09:37] 50_tiger: Pretty much anywhere south of the Mason Dixon line it is like that lol
[7:09:38] SturmSauer: amen
[7:09:39] jefemd: if you pull expect they will too type shit
[7:09:40] Drew708: Jordan has literally won a case with self defence
[7:09:40] BadHabitss: Joy is doing an accent, hes American
[7:09:40] bender1101: its a british thing according online, new york and cali dont use this nonsence
[7:09:41] nocorras: that's actually wild what was she supposed to do if 2 people were wailing on him
[7:09:42] BlueGiant621: The law allows a person to use deadly force anytime they are at risk of bodily harm or they feel their life is threatened.
[7:09:42] killerbeartiger0: You get more charges if you do not kill the person, in some states
[7:09:43] Smoakytreats: Take it Out = Air it Out Dog!
[7:09:43] huccilol: now if u say he had a knife that’s a different story
[7:09:44] MagicBananas__: yuh thats basic gun safety, pulling a gun is not treated lightly
[7:09:46] Warped_Realm: the second you believe it's required to use a gun is the second you're ready to let it bang, and if you don't then there was no "need" for it in the first place *shrugs*
[7:09:46] flogbishop: read the law what does it say exactly
[7:09:47] SCROTEX: I mean punches aren’t the only type of physical assaults either like???
[7:09:48] jack_wumbo: Joy was giving the 1v1 scenario for some reason and wouldn't consider the actual proportionality of this situation
[7:09:48] CaptainKoma: Yeah
[7:09:48] ThePurging: matching force shouldn't be a thing for civs
[7:09:49] Jasenesis: better off getting the law changed tbh
[7:09:50] Grivvvy: they havent been for jordan lol
[7:09:51] SnitchBubbles: yeah thats awful
[7:09:52] carthagelost: My friend was getting assaulted with and got thrown on the ground and he was getting pnched, he punched the other guy out and he had a gun, and the cop asked him why he didn't use the gun lol
[7:09:55] The_Nixon_of_NASCAR: that is actually bad ruling
[7:09:56] d33w33d: I think what matters most is that you fear for your life
[7:09:57] sirbittle: it was like 4-5 dudes vs daisy
[7:09:57] OctoNox: others judges have ruled in your favor in situations like these before
[7:09:57] kanzler1871: @yoDeRock please dont throw the b word around like that willy nilly kids watch this stream
[7:09:57] KidKickingRobot: for RP its fun yeah
[7:09:58] Cory1750: how does a woman defend themselves against a man without a gun
[7:09:58] TheSkyfarer: gotta truly make this the UK and start stabbing people
[7:09:59] Demosthenex: Someone bashing ur head into the curb but u can't shoot them lol
[7:09:59] dtekc: definently needas a specific city law
[7:09:59] bagool1: You can def try to bring it up IC and get it changed
[7:09:59] WaterChampsoowoo: @Bpapman LUL no, that's insanely wrong
[7:10:00] GreatAmericanTotalEclipse: PEPW
[7:10:01] KLR_Adventure: you cant just go around punching people
[7:10:01] GT_Alex74: You should, otherwise it will have big mechanical consequences
[7:10:01] Meatyfrog: @Bpapman if you pull a gun and it's not to shoot, you're literally brandishing
[7:10:02] BuddyFerngrove: also they expect a girl to take on 2 guys?
[7:10:03] soundOrbit: In Britain Bruv they just throw acid at each other no guns
[7:10:03] EpidemicToast: Self defense is not a fight fight
[7:10:04] Chunko_Muffo: If you have a gun, and get incapacitated -- that's deadly
[7:10:04] compoundenum: something that glaring should be codified into the law, not at judge discretion
[7:10:04] activ00: I think only Joy rules this way
[7:10:04] souper1: Every state agrees that you could defend yourself there
[7:10:05] domesticgorilla: Is the proportional force written down?
[7:10:05] NOPEWALK: how would prosecution appeal work with double jeopardy monkaHmm
[7:10:05] Adewi: punch equals kill someone
[7:10:05] roguegunslinger1: hes saying you have to defend yourself with fists?
[7:10:05] ShrimpCommander: 4Head just roll up 4v1 and punch them to death
[7:10:07] nocorras: you take the death bro
[7:10:08] robsmad: KEKW
[7:10:09] froggyrl: it’s actually an nvl ruling
[7:10:10] tmalles: earlier you shot someone after being punched and was let off
[7:10:11] littleBIGmanz: KEKL
[7:10:12] anextremeemo: ohh
[7:10:12] nub_cake_: Euros NotLikeThis
[7:10:14] Kaprah: Shruge Guess I'll die?
[7:10:14] Hotot1: Its RP, you have to let people do whatever they want to you
[7:10:14] Klan_Itsme: cops can go to gun from fist
[7:10:14] SnitchBubbles: brave victim NODDERS
[7:10:14] randomrpviewer: Yeah that should probably be changed
[7:10:15] AztecKniight: People are about to spam punch the fuck out of everyone KEKW
[7:10:15] flogbishop: OMEGALAUGHING
[7:10:15] communitysquarejerk: OMEGALUOL
[7:10:15] PeebleTheory: someone can perma from punches just like a bullet
[7:10:15] Aveal01: Can you taze someone if they're punching you?
[7:10:16] gambit_: I feel like it's about the perceived threat which is hard to RP vs IRL
[7:10:16] tedium7: birpaNoted
[7:10:16] Cordis2Die: Jordan nerfed Sadge
[7:10:16] muffledstatue2: China server
[7:10:17] Thor_Garden: @PENTA If a cop gets punched, can they respond with a gun?
[7:10:17] CLERIKX: twitter has that exact video
[7:10:17] Vondill: Hell no someone punces me they getting shot
[7:10:18] Clucky206: what happens if you pull a gun on someone to stop them and they punch you anyway Penta
[7:10:18] captainshtbox: PEPW nah just get your ass stomped
[7:10:18] NomadDee: That ruling is actually horrible for women too
[7:10:19] freedomboy696969: nvl ruling
[7:10:19] guerillathrilla: going for gun
[7:10:19] SkittlenautX: I mean what do you even do then if you're getting 2v1 fisted??
[7:10:20] AlwaysRecon: KEKW
[7:10:21] badonkaboots5: just take the L if its 4 people smashing your skull in Shruge
[7:10:21] i_am_beardman: yeah i learned in my CCW class that someone punching you is a valid situation for self defense because you can lose conciousness @penta
[7:10:22] holyknightgoldan: WOOW i didn't know
[7:10:22] stochasticdev: @PENTA I can understand 1v1 but anything over 1v1 will make it impossible to defend with equal force, makes no fuckin sense LUL
[7:10:23] buffynaz: also RP punches can kill you
[7:10:23] BanyTV: oh, wait, can you start punching cops then?
[7:10:24] GoodCat480: didnt the guy who shot that youtuber in the mall get off
[7:10:25] NopeFaqew: If someone attacks me before I know, Ingame especially you automatically lose unless that person messes up
[7:10:25] safewordbazinga: DinkDonk greca
[7:10:26] popinlocknessmonster: Didn't he get let go for shooting a woman who punched him a few hours ago
[7:10:27] Vengas: cops cant shoot you if you punch them Pog
[7:10:28] RyuShinden: @PENTA One of my characters was adamant on shooting people that steal his stuff, but the lawyers say to him he cannot shoot a gun even when threatened KEKW
[7:10:28] spazzshell: Haven’t some of Jordan’s cases ruled him being in self defense when he shoots someone while he’s getting hit?
[7:10:29] Filikeu: Guess they are against guns
[7:10:29] CloudIKicker: pentawThinking
[7:10:29] ZackFW254: only like 11 states have duty to retreat
[7:10:29] captaincabinetts: is citizen fear for life different than cop fear for life?? @PENTA
[7:10:30] Bpapman: @Meatyfrog dog brandishing is against no perceivable threat
[7:10:30] Peter_TM: duty to retreat is a state law thing, my state requires it
[7:10:30] HeyUdontSay_That1010: what the pint of a gun license?? only allowed to pull a gun after someone pulls a gun on you
[7:10:32] kwell: bLoom
[7:10:33] angryseesaw: Wait does that mean any time the cops have lethal out its escalation?
[7:10:33] Bigxmage: first aid training right there
[7:10:34] Erendyll: proportionality should be server healthed out its just stupid
[7:10:35] TenderTeemo: What's the RP rules, if a gun is pulled can you shoot back or just hands up @PENTA
[7:10:36] Kemli: no not at all
[7:10:39] IamSovietBear: Think about a woman vs a large man
[7:10:40] omniplex924: your most likely knocked out
[7:10:40] buddhabatman: yeah didn't Jordan literally shoot someone in self defense like 4 hours ago?

[7:10:42] vantarts: they can spam punch you
[7:10:43] DeliriousBeast: Strength differnces are a thing
[7:10:44] granddemon: @HeyUdontSay_That1010 Now you're banned for NVL
[7:10:45] Milk_exe: If you are smaller you are already at a disadvantage
[7:10:47] captainlucha: i'm so hecking angry
[7:10:47] Stew_pididiot: Stew_pididiot subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[7:10:47] exhume125: That a gun isn't a self defense to being bludgeoned without a prior agreement is madness
[7:10:48] tosfriendlyname: i really like joy, not a fan of that law though
[7:10:48] tigerpapa9: You punch, they pull gun, then you can shoot them.
[7:10:49] glazedscronut: 1v1? chat still thinking videogame terms
[7:10:49] MacTheWhopper: sucker punched in the back of the head is gg
[7:10:50] doogar: and if you get knocked out or on the ground your life is in danger like tthat is so insanely backwards
[7:10:50] Vondill: If you go down they can take your gun and shoot you
[7:10:50] nottuned: or if you 5'4 and the other guy 6'5
[7:10:51] xpIosive: like you said all it takes is 1 punch
[7:10:51] KidKickingRobot: after u get sucker punched are they contiinuing to punch u??
[7:10:51] 600i_: if they knock you out they can keep hitting you
[7:10:51] asleepycamper: If you're on the ground you're dead
[7:10:52] StepOnAHen_: get punched for RP
[7:10:52] OneNiceLad: just 1v1 Rust Bro
[7:10:52] AlwaysRecon: I think you need to get hit twice
[7:10:53] bender1101: its cause the brits dont have guns, so a proportionate defense makes sense
[7:10:53] Cordis2Die: Next: Judge Steele GIGACHAD
[7:10:53] DromiTM: Punching cops POG
[7:10:53] Grivvvy: yeah chances are youre fucked if youre not a fighter or just an iron jawed mf
[7:10:53] Pokemon_Janitor: @PENTA you think you have time to get a gun after getting sucker punched?
[7:10:54] DadlyShadow: UK law, basically some car driver seen a woman being attacked, he drove over them both, and claimed self defence and won, usa people know nothing about uk laws
[7:10:54] sirbittle: she didn't use the gun either until they drew guns
[7:10:54] NomadDee: have these mf's never been rocked before. You can't recover unless you're use to it.
[7:10:55] omniplex924: one hit to the temple is game over
[7:10:55] froggyrl: one punch can literally end you in a split second
[7:10:55] ShrimpCommander: LUL too many people have never been in a fist fight to know that
[7:10:56] narvahhh: I dont think the judges have ever been in a IRL fight, getting hit in the face will daze you LUL
[7:10:56] FalconsFrenzy: also stated you cant shoot in self defense unless they have shot first
[7:10:56] Gooshman: Any force used must be reasonable in the circumstances as the person honestly perceived them to be, after making allowance for the fact that SOME DEGREE OF EXCESS FORCE  might still be reasonable in the HEAT OF THE MOMENT
[7:10:56] cssko_: you're going to jail dog lmao
[7:10:56] flogbishop: what about a bat vs fist?
[7:10:57] BobRossSaladToss: if it's one punch and things cool off i get it
[7:10:57] Glynnys: you shouldnt be rewarding people for starting fights
[7:10:58] BadHabitss: @DeliriousBeast how does that apply to RP OMEGALAUGHING
[7:10:58] ttt50xx: also that idea of self defense assumes people are equally sized
[7:10:58] nocorras: the way they're ruling on it's just dumb, there is no way Daisy could reasonably stop them with equal  force
[7:10:58] oblick: also what if the person attacking you is much bigger and stronger???
[7:10:58] sterowentUS: and also, this is the world of GTA. surely that lends itself to the RP in some fashion
[7:10:59] fuuhhzz: they can just spam and you're done
[7:10:59] odaidai: I feel like people haven't been assaulted before.
[7:10:59] ZeroMoonGuard: Maybe assault joy on mike KEKW
[7:11:00] 0Viking_: Chat has never been in a fight
[7:11:00] Grivvvy: yeah
[7:11:00] magicianstrikesagain: definitely lol
[7:11:01] PeebleTheory: people have perma’d from being beat in RP
[7:11:01] GT_Alex74: Even just someone who knows how to fight VS someone who doesn't
[7:11:02] Zietlogik: a consentual fight maybe
[7:11:02] daggre_actual: when you fight, its for your life 100%
[7:11:02] Shake4L: we just had to jail an airmen last year because of that at a bar @PENTA
[7:11:02] rykoxd93: if he means in the city then they also dont die from guns
[7:11:02] KLR_Adventure: punches dont usually kill people but hitting ur head on the ground will
[7:11:03] gibsox: bro that lamp story on reddit is wild
[7:11:03] froggyrl: yea
[7:11:03] badonkaboots5: yeah idk if he was talking rp or irl
[7:11:03] Huso833: Houdini died from getting punched
[7:11:04] FishOutOfH2O: can you shoot some one with a bat?
[7:11:04] Nick10153: People who make the arguement fists are not deadly or potentially deadly sound like they came from a very safe area.
[7:11:05] tangents4: Especially like this, a woman vs 3 dudes....
[7:11:05] TheRealGorg: my wrestling coach killed someone in germany with one punch
[7:11:06] ToastedRubber: Old fat guy  vs young health guy  -- Woman vs Man.. Gun is the equalizer
[7:11:06] GayHibiscus: armpit punches can kill
[7:11:07] daschneider92: i have to assume he just means in server
[7:11:07] Kemli: literallly all thetime at what, Clluckin Bell
[7:11:07] RyuuBaka: @PENTA imagine a woman in the situation. LOLOL I guess they just die Shruge
[7:11:07] BadHabitss: Not in Los Santos they dont
[7:11:07] Unitedterror: @PENTA manslaughter happens literally multiple times a day
[7:11:08] Jertzukka: He's saying that nobody in RP dies to punches, neither does anyone die to guns on this server
[7:11:08] Anonyless: @PENTA i wonder what about gods joke? aka a single punch to the middle of the forehead will kill 1 in 100 people due to a common birth defect
[7:11:08] pyroricosuave: Pavements
[7:11:08] Hindar23: 5% of US murders
[7:11:08] slurmy: maybe he's arguing mechanics since people dont die from one punch in game
[7:11:08] faceman209: True
[7:11:08] shloopanoodle: getting sucker punched is just a bit of banter over there
[7:11:09] ayyfamo: because people don't fist fight in Britain they just stab each other
[7:11:09] melomaniacjh: @penta also they are the aggressor and therefore forfeit a right to some weird equal playing field
[7:11:10] The_Nixon_of_NASCAR: does joy think fist arent judge blunt instruments?
[7:11:10] Clucky206: that’s some mechanics argument Penta
[7:11:11] piruc: I don't know if he means in game or irl pentawKek
[7:11:11] kinjoyojimbo: he must be out of touch
[7:11:11] hiddentalent424: they fall and hit there heads
[7:11:11] fuuhhzz: 1 punch is all it takes
[7:11:11] Cory1750: you can pull a gun just because you feel like your life is in danger
[7:11:12] ArticKong: think he meant in the city but even then???
[7:11:12] doogar: @PENTA i assumed he meant in the city
[7:11:12] SACancel: I mean, in her statement daisy said she warned them not to come closer before opening fire
[7:11:12] kingofakina: happened recently
[7:11:12] JackDanylz: Oh yeah

[7:13:50] Aveal01: In NZ you can get 10-20 years for punches to the back of the head
[7:13:50] narvahhh: yeah but Canadians are not even allowed to have guns tho
[7:13:51] hop_please: @HotWrestledad Too many
[7:13:51] PapaG_306: we are the worst
[7:13:51] bagool1: even 1 higher is better
[7:13:51] JustForGrins_: canada is just the UK in NA
[7:13:52] NOPEWALK: I feel like you could get this changed IC without any of the OOC considerations tbh
[7:13:52] Kemli: this is a US GTA sandbox DESKCHAN
[7:13:53] zealous_tran: LOS SANTOS CANDIA
[7:13:53] soundOrbit: if a guy pulls a sword, you must pull a sword and match them
[7:13:53] Blackstone01: shouldn't it be based on US law?
[7:13:54] fuuhhzz: fuckin Canadians Madge
[7:13:54] mukozz: @PENTA can't you guys just pass a law that removes that requirement?
[7:13:54] 2Canoe: its a terrible law
[7:13:54] KidKickingRobot: you havent?
[7:13:54] Davaliraine: if someone punches you you say sorry
[7:13:56] jaymooze: they'll commit war crimes but wont kill each other. canadians
[7:13:56] Chunko_Muffo: Well, I think he just doesn't understand proportional response
[7:13:56] KUMZILLER: guna are illegal in Canada
[7:13:56] MisterTohru: it doesnt exist in the USA WHATSOEVER

[7:13:57] vegaobscura: @PENTA Ask Greco?
[7:13:58] stevemeh: I thought this was an American server
[7:13:58] spicycapicola: Canada is cucked
[7:13:58] TenderTeemo: matching force is british AF @PENTA
[7:13:59] Grivvvy: @nub_cake_ not for self defense
[7:13:59] Je_rk: You can get self defense for shooting in Canada it just happened
[7:14:00] Crowhav3n: ggwp
[7:14:00] glazedscronut: it leaves way too much to opinion and interpretation
[7:14:00] Dlton: Canada is just shittier UK
[7:14:00] muffledstatue2: F that irl
[7:14:00] ayyfamo: joy saying women just have to get beat up by their husbands because they aren't using a weapon is actually a secret Jordan w
[7:14:00] ShrimpCommander: saying canadian may as well say british 4Head subjects of crown
[7:14:00] Bpapman: @Meatyfrog the whole wording around most brandishing laws are improper displays in aggressive manners. Just unholstering a weapon isnt brandishing
[7:14:01] fishuuuu: can police not escalate +1 then?
[7:14:01] TheRealGorg: matching force is UK and Austrailia i think
[7:14:02] GayHibiscus: @Rickets89 very few home invasions are fatal in terms of criminals committing them. The world is not out to get you.
[7:14:02] bubblyrug: so the attacker just gets to choose the level of force?
[7:14:02] sheepbiter: man vs woman is already mismatched force
[7:14:02] iLoch: it's not a problem for us because we dont have people carrying guns on 24/7 lolz
[7:14:02] UglyCretin: KEKL los santos is now canada
[7:14:04] motolemur: you have to match force if someone breanks into your house where I live LUL
[7:14:04] johntwitchchat: its a shit law
[7:14:05] gambit_: it would be common sense if you grew up there, just like we Americans like to murder KEKL
[7:14:06] AztecKniight: KKona bunch of lib shit
[7:14:06] goldrite: @KUMZILLER thats so not true LUL
[7:14:08] SACancel: I mean you just aren't allowed to fuckin kill someone
[7:14:08] robin1904: Matching Acorns
[7:14:08] NomadDee: Objection: Not U.S. law
[7:14:08] d_vander: it just kills good people
[7:14:08] exipx: cops don't match force either
[7:14:09] OneNiceLad: Peruze did this
[7:14:10] SACancel: you can mess them up still
[7:14:10] Kemli: keep the matching to the cops for RP reason
[7:14:11] Reijn: LUL that gun range dude really was based.
[7:14:12] BobRossSaladToss: can be changed in RP NODDERS
[7:14:13] Huso833: sounds more like a server rule?
[7:14:13] masterlearner21: Don't be a woman, I guess
[7:14:13] PeebleTheory: this kills towing
[7:14:14] carthagelost: The funniest part is any and all force can be lethal
[7:14:15] Ol_Geiser: "The gun is the equalizer" was such a hard line
[7:14:16] Th3GBeard: what if youre a 70 year old woman? I'm sure her punches will stop the aggressor lol
[7:14:16] CaptainKoma: I mean you could boil it down more, someone could have rings
[7:14:17] MisterTohru: the phrase usually used in the US is "reasonable fear for your life" @PENTA
[7:14:17] WaterChampsoowoo: LUL canada so backwards
[7:14:18] odaidai: matching force is a law. Unless you can express that you are in fear for your life.
[7:14:19] Wraithknight: Yeah so if a woman is getting her ass beat shes not allowed to use a gun
[7:14:19] Rickets89: @GayHibiscus  oh i know, i'm canadian so just a little self deprecation
[7:14:19] Spancaster: are we just gonna sit here and pretend that canada is real
[7:14:21] fomiplays: if you get punched you just have to try to punch them back
[7:14:21] gambit_: that's gonna fuck the tow game over so bad
[7:14:21] carthagelost: Even non-lethal force can kill you
[7:14:23] Loremipsum21: I've heard of proportionality being a thing in America. The problem is punching can be deadly so Joy is wrong.
[7:14:24] Jertzukka: interpretation
[7:14:24] Zefalon: force matrix is okay for cops, for civs its very dumb
[7:14:25] JackDanylz: MiltonTpike brought this up a while ago and thought it was insane as a Canadian

[7:14:26] CloudIKicker: Well rip to anyone small and not strong
[7:14:27] ethiopianing: @PENTA i feel like a reasonable person would assume there life is in danger if they are being attacked LUL
[7:14:28] sterowentUS: well, he is a judge
[7:14:28] TheJuiceLight: As a Brit, I disagree with matching force, sounds like a canadian thing. In America, women are legit told to get a gun to protect their self from male threats due to biological differences.
[7:14:29] IchiFi: Mike tyson bout to run up on those grandma's NODDERS cause they can't legally defend themselves
[7:14:29] Pokemon_Janitor: ITS ALSO THE LAW IN AMERICA
[7:14:30] Grulll: no self defense with anything but fists
[7:14:30] dark_sided93: Lol leave that server their laws are no good
[7:14:30] avarice176: The proportionality is kinda a thing in the U.S. He's just misunderstanding it
[7:14:31] Huso833: Yeah cuz hasn't Jordan used his gun first before
[7:14:31] PurpleHW: So if a cop gets punched and is close to being punched out can they not shoot?
[7:14:31] Ol_Geiser: NODDERS

[7:14:47] Seriphax: It's not a law in Canada, you can't carry guns in public here
[7:14:47] Adewi: @penta Like many states, Pennsylvania has a “Stand your Ground” law — also known as a “Shoot First” law — that expands the right to use lethal force in self-defense.
[7:14:48] orpsel: gun*
[7:14:48] dtekc: honestly just sounds like a judge by judge / city opinion at this point

[7:15:18] Cerbivision: it doesnt work
[7:15:18] d33w33d: you do have to prove when using deadly force in self defense that it was reasonable to do so
[7:15:18] WaterChampsoowoo: always carry
[7:15:18] Meatyfrog: @Bpapman how I've always been taught, if you feel safe enough that you can upholster a firearm to "disarm" a situation then you're probably more likely than not commited brandishing
[7:15:19] dae_bed: deadly force should be met with deadly force, I think Joy thought it was a stupid scuffle not a brutal assault I suppose
[7:15:19] odaidai: O/C spray hits everyone.
[7:15:19] Impurite: @Loremipsum21 it is. Brandishing and misuse of a weapon are charges but cops are allowed to use their judgement on charges to push, so if the cops don't see it as out of line to use a gun for defense they don't have to.
[7:15:19] flogbishop: some pepper themselves
[7:15:19] TheZodiac25: Pulling the trigger is a different story tho, especially for women

[7:15:24] Clucky206: no beer mace. 9mm
[7:15:24] BeegJon_: Pulling a gun either de-escalates the situation or you defend yourself. Any other way feels like NVL or just promoting fighting to me. Lol @penta
[7:15:25] KidKickingRobot: does no one remember the George Zimmeron case?
[7:15:26] Rickets89: sometimes it just might make someone  more angry
[7:15:26] stochasticdev: @PENTA thats the other weird part, he is only thinking about minor injury or deadly, lot of terrible shit in between
[7:15:26] PrimalEmotions: Sometimes you really need 30 rounds for self-defense. Gladge
[7:15:26] fuuhhzz: you just end up pepper spraying yourself too
[7:15:26] nub_cake_: Blowback too

[7:15:36] lutner44: you are able to use lethal force so long as it’s reasonable for you to do so. if you get punched in the gut once almost certainly can’t just pull a gun and pop off. obviously if your jumped by 10 people it’s more reasonable to use lethal force
[7:15:36] OneNiceLad: Hell yeah
[7:15:36] daschneider92: that's what really throws me
[7:15:36] NomadDee: Never use spray, use gel.

[7:15:49] piruc: I don't think anyone but the judges feel this way pentawKek
[7:15:50] ayyfamo: because cops are sensible it seems with self defense
[7:15:50] Smierce: Joy has definitely ruled oppositely on jordan before????
[7:15:52] JordanVsTheWorld1: as long as your guns in locked you can carry a gun in Canada.. You cant use it for self defense either
[7:15:53] FishOutOfH2O: cops are seeing it as self defense
[7:15:53] xNess22x: KEKW
[7:15:55] Rickets89: I wouldn't be surprised if most people just assumed that's how it was

[7:16:04] IHITHOMERS_: @Cernem next weekend
[7:16:06] Jamblar: Based on what Grecko said the other judges might not even think that way
[7:16:07] CuttyNA: if it isn't written in legislation that's probably why they dont know

[7:16:36] NomadDee: If you don't know what they're gonna do when they knock you out...
[7:16:39] popinlocknessmonster: since it started with illegal violence, shouldn't everything after also be illegal
[7:16:41] BeegJon_: Of course cops see it as self defense because that's the first thing they would do if getting cold cocked. Haha

[7:16:51] TenderTeemo: @Kyle honest question because IDK the answer - in RP if you got a gun on you, can you pull your gun out or just hands up?
[7:16:53] PeebleTheory: that’s why road rage is dangerous af
[7:16:53] p0pnfr3sh: @penta doesn’t that go against the police force +1 matrix??
[7:16:53] Kemli: it keeps it simple , doesn't muddle nvl, and it equalises a fight or causes a standoff.

[7:17:19] Thaang: just pull out a golf club
[7:17:19] Nick10153: If people perma to fist fights, maybe it will change.
[7:17:20] TheeYeti: also woman irl are weaker then men and the gun is the equalizer
