[12:19:52] LolmanScott: the lilke calf
[12:19:56] lilpiinkfrog: was that not a baby cow?
[12:20:05] Vizi797: That's for sure Julio's room
[12:20:28] LunarFlash: are there taxidermy animals as props in 4.0
[12:20:30] brbdoo: What that dog doin
[12:20:37] Anrisacia: !cow
[12:20:37] Nightbot: The main character 🐮 #EponaIsDumb
[12:20:55] honor234567: Woodcabin vibes are so cozy
[12:21:08] mackobd3: good morning (:
[12:21:22] brbdoo: A kitchen setup like an apothecary would be dope
[12:22:45] ThePartyGuest: these new decorating mechanics are so cool
[12:23:27] brbdoo: It bugs the hell out of me that the grid lines aren't square though
[12:26:47] Madam_Orange: unless it’s like only in the middle kivaSus
[12:27:00] brbdoo: ziggyjHmm
[12:27:31] Madam_Orange: like what if there’s a middle staircase that you made with a hidden upper Harry Potter room
[12:28:08] brbdoo: Make it look like there's a structural pillar going all the way through the house? ziggyjHmm
[12:29:17] Matrix8369: I wish there was an easy like quick align to the houses orientation. So when you move items, its a lot easier
[12:29:24] Vizi797: kivaPog
[12:29:24] Thrath: Yooo
[12:29:26] Madam_Orange: woaaaa
[12:29:38] Jen848: lol
[12:29:54] Holrend: how are the other stairs looks like?
[12:30:21] Qmaster2: Does it have to have the spiral stairs?
[12:30:54] brbdoo: Why not hop in the editor and block out some quick floors first? You could probably get 3 stories
[12:31:09] lblvckmvgicl: kivaSus
[12:31:21] brbdoo: Don't have to do the whole floor, just something to tell you where it would be
[12:31:46] zeman94: Well the bottom floor can go down level with the door to the bench
[12:32:01] Anillian: kivaBobble
[12:32:14] Qmaster2: The only way around that would to be build more walls below it on the inside to make it flush
[12:32:32] Qmaster2: But then you lose space on the bottom floor
[12:32:33] j0shst3r: 3 floors at slightly above door height?
[12:33:06] Madam_Orange: not unless you use smaller floor/wall pieces
[12:34:54] Thrath: Would essentially be a crawl space
[12:34:54] Nightbot: Follow Kiva on Twitter! <3 https://twitter.com/KivaLive <3  Join Kiva's community on Discord! https://discord.gg/Tm7UzE8cem <3
[12:35:03] lblvckmvgicl: oh i wonder if there is enough room to walk behind if you were to make walls that are set to match up with that step out
[12:35:48] Qmaster2: Yeah, you'd be cutting off that bit of space but it would at least line up with the lip
[12:36:01] brbdoo: You could crouch under it for sure if you want to put secret storage in those spaces under the lip
[12:36:08] squoogelol: DinkDonk pallet
[12:36:14] Vizi797: Yea I was wondering if you just extended the lip down to the bottom, would it leave enough space for like a hidden hallways behind the walls
[12:36:33] lblvckmvgicl: yee exactly vizi
[12:36:43] lblvckmvgicl: that was my thought process
[12:37:10] lblvckmvgicl: where it jogs out
[12:37:16] lblvckmvgicl: yee
[12:37:16] Vizi797: Like if you placed a wall flush with the part that's jutting out yea.
[12:37:18] Qmaster2: between the wall down fromt he lip aand the real wall
[12:37:35] Vizi797: Yea exactly
[12:37:37] Qmaster2: yeah
[12:37:50] lblvckmvgicl: so it would be like a passage to a secret room
[12:37:56] brbdoo: You could go all the way down or just the middle floor too
[12:38:18] brbdoo: That way you have more space to work with on the bottom floor
[12:38:28] SadButRad1_: have you thought of trying to recreate what you want to do in the sims FIRST (since building is easier) and then applying it to NP?
[12:38:30] Qmaster2: It would be a hidden spot. but the trade off is you lose some of the floor space
[12:39:59] Lunesta777: to bad the ceiling is low could’ve made a goblin attic
[12:40:14] Qmaster2: dang, would that thinnder one even have enough room to walk into?
[12:40:21] Holrend: put a stair there that distract from the secret room
[12:40:22] lblvckmvgicl: with it being thinner would you be able to sneak along it like with andi's back against the wall
[12:40:46] Anillian: btw did you see what happened when the lannisters got into that car accident?
[12:41:00] lblvckmvgicl: yee true
[12:41:10] Vizi797: KEKW
[12:41:14] lblvckmvgicl: LUL
[12:41:14] Nightbot: kivaLUL
[12:41:16] Thrath: KEKW
[12:41:45] Vizi797: Fireball Forward + X to get to the bench NODDERS
[12:41:47] Qmaster2: Need to teach all of the boys the combo to get into the weed room KEKW
[12:42:06] lblvckmvgicl: i didnt think about the buttons that had to be pressed to do that KEKW
[12:42:23] ykicka: what do you mean you don't want to have to Dodge, duck, dip, dive and Dodge just to get into a room?
[12:42:40] brbdoo: Interiors are always what gets me. It's like oh cool it's an open canvas :) oh shit it's an open canvas :(
[12:42:41] zeman94: So could you do the the wall and then a tiny room where the furniture stash is?
[12:43:00] lblvckmvgicl: ahh ok
[12:43:23] lblvckmvgicl: oh like dexx's wall
[12:43:29] lblvckmvgicl: LUL
[12:43:29] Nightbot: kivaLUL
[12:43:43] Qmaster2: Seems like the stairs are all the same styles just different colors
[12:43:46] ItsJardo: or do the Konami code to reach your bench KEKW
[12:44:59] Qmaster2: I'm picturing a hous with a bunch of seperate rooms and all the stairs and hallways are just planks you have to walk across
[12:45:00] venkaramon: Is it not possible to remove the spiral staircase? It just seems so in the way lol
[12:45:02] zeman94: You could use the single steps to make a thing like the pit walls
[12:45:55] Kate: can i give smol tip that changed my life
[12:46:09] lblvckmvgicl: kivaHi kate
[12:46:54] Kate: katesHi

[12:49:09] Kate: lol
[12:49:14] AloofMango: lol
[12:49:39] Kate: second, when scrolling through options in the decorating list, hold shift, and you won't have to move your camera. it'll just replace the item with the new one katesFlower
[12:50:15] Kate: so choose a stair case or something you're looking at
[12:50:25] Kate: now hold shift, and click a new item from the list
[12:50:43] Kate: it's now loading in near to you, so you don't have to move the camera back each time
[12:51:03] Kate: welcome! it saved me a lot of zooming around which was miserable
[12:51:04] Jen848: very nice
[12:51:08] lblvckmvgicl: kivaPog
[12:51:27] Kate: and for that, just run outside and come back in
[12:51:48] Kate: NotLikeThis
[12:51:56] Kate: oh wtf
[12:52:00] Kate: awkward
[12:52:17] ItsJardo: it would be so cool if you could place things in your yard and decorate it as well
[12:52:24] Vizi797: Computers are already gone now kivaSad
[12:52:25] Kate: EZ
[12:52:57] Kate: i at least got my spawn point outside which is nice
[12:53:35] seablasty: dont have to leave home to touch grass

[12:55:08] lblvckmvgicl: you could maybe make a little step up at the door to give a little more room for the floors below
[12:56:07] brbdoo: A snap tool would be awesome
[12:56:13] lblvckmvgicl: that would be dope
[12:56:17] AloofMango: a secret door curvyeHmm
[12:56:17] cqo6: like obs or ps files?
[12:56:41] lblvckmvgicl: is there any sort of sliding doors ?
[12:57:01] Vizi797: I immediately imagined it like Tears of the Kingdom with like sticking things together with the green goo lol
[12:57:32] squoogelol: im curious about what the creating a room thing is
[12:58:32] zeman94: You could get rid of the room for walls you can test with
[12:58:55] AloofMango: yeah the search is broad
[12:59:22] Exedos094: mold YEP
