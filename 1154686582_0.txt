[6:35:45] shanghaiftw: no eye scuff uhnBless
[6:35:45] EviL_Us_S: 4 this time
[6:35:54] Delfryngr: Gamba! Jammies
[6:35:54] Fireghostly: In GTA Vanilla, The Brawler does like 117 MPH along with having great acceleration if it's fully upgraded. I don't know anything about NoPixel tho.
[6:35:58] lowbow_: so is the raid not worth getting in 3.0?
[6:35:59] TheGodfather2994: @evil_us_s u voted 3
[6:36:01] synex_ini: 2 inc Kappa
[6:36:02] Anch09: Dont jinx it James

[6:36:29] CaliPackFan: are there any nice trucks?
[6:36:31] Azhogh: A brawler will do the trick just fine
[6:36:31] EviL_Us_S: go 3
[6:36:35] b__u__n: raid gonna get a buff soon COPIUM
[6:36:39] shanghaiftw: james must be snitching again

[6:36:39] griffin_x_m: Been watching nova since before I even had a nicotine addiction
[6:36:40] EviL_Us_S: hahaha
[6:36:40] j0shst3r: vagrant is 400k in tuner right? that one upgraded might be good
[6:36:41] Lamemo: too much money for a B class
[6:36:44] MsAutumnWind: if it were me I'd ask Eddie to justify the minor price difference between 3 full classes LOL
[6:36:46] Helcack: He might fix it after you get caught way too often in it. @UberHaxorNova and people using their tuner cars get away all the time
[6:36:48] mrcold_pants: just fucking tell eddie to he's face "it's not worth it" XD
[6:36:48] Flexoatsman: lets go 4?
[6:36:50] Delfryngr: Susge
[6:36:59] Fireghostly: Maxwell Vagrant? @j0shst3r
[6:37:08] poot_follows: atleast it'll be a 1 of 1 since on one else would be dumb enough to spend money on it
[6:37:08] Bansou: the Raid is a challenger with off road tires it should still drive like a challenger, maybe just a little less acceleration because the weight added
[6:37:09] Kinjah808: How good is the hoa brawler
[6:37:11] j0shst3r: @Fireghostly the buggy
[6:37:16] PhantomDoxx: So big 3?

[6:37:19] Delfryngr: self your gamba's are too complicated for my brain uhnSuffer
[6:37:23] Fireghostly: Ah, yes.
[6:37:26] CannibalPuppies: @Kinjah808 not as good as it used to be Sadge
[6:37:27] blazinginferno24: raid should be a A class DESKCHAN
[6:37:32] StaticEchos: Eddie pls uhnSuffer
[6:37:33] inadeq8: Let me predict with my points PLS uhnSuffer
[6:37:35] kuro_xvi: Raid was gonna be an A class no?
[6:37:36] Hento: you jumped alot of dividers tho
[6:37:41] Azhogh: Offroad = B class, that's what i understood from his reasoning
[6:37:44] vodin__: He has a huge amount on his plate but the Raid is really slow for what it should be
[6:37:49] ItsDepressedGamer: Is it possible to try to talk to Eddie about upgrading the class?
[6:37:50] EviL_Us_S: haggle like always
[6:37:52] cowmanboypig123: Is just crazy with the price of the raid and an S S+
[6:37:54] mrcold_pants: i don't think that he'll understand unless you tell him :/
[6:37:55] b__u__n: that was once KEKW
[6:37:56] TheGodfather2994: @galatiaak they taxed his alleyway next to his shop
[6:37:56] Dierseus9: did it once
[6:37:57] Hento: KEKW ok
[6:37:59] vodin__: slow down the top speed but the thing should have good acceleration
[6:38:02] ninjapenjuinLIVE: if you do use it like that, it will get nerfed even harder
[6:38:07] DoomsdayBomb: The Giga chase with Rhodes was amazing
[6:38:08] Hento: thats like the only time you used it in a chase tho
[6:38:08] Sparkt: price is crazy for the raid
[6:38:10] 0xygenhomie: youve seen him do it maybe twice lol
[6:38:10] MsAutumnWind: paying for a B class that's only 40K less than a S class is just bad business/bad purchase
[6:38:11] regworth: and the main cop in that chase was underwood KEKW
[6:38:13] CannibalPuppies: KEKW
[6:38:14] TheGaffer88: barely ever drove the raid tbh
[6:38:15] dsiOne: KEKW
[6:38:16] 3spada_Grande: It's locked behind a off road class cage

[6:38:34] lowbow_: I'm assuming because it's an off-road vehicle that it's ranked as a B class

[6:38:44] Joeyrushes: What’s ratty mean?
[6:38:46] Drax_1X: Cop bike kind of devalues that type of rattiness too

[6:40:40] 3spada_Grande: Was that a part of the multiple hostage flecca hop
[6:40:49] Gnihtemos: @Joeyrushes kinda Sizs tuner car can go over dividers/up mountains all day but James tends to avoid that cause thats not fun for anyone
[6:41:03] Bansou: yall ever think about how the prison on the server is its own pocket dimension and time is faster there?
