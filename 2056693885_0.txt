[0:42:53] Bionic_Devil: yeah crime is picking up finally
[0:43:22] Stealthkillah122: @nicole  how ? I tried to keep that secret. You been following me futchPanic
[0:43:33] Chrissy1337: idk about the finally thing, i think progression has been very nice so far Bionic_Devil
[0:44:01] Nicole: @stealthkillah122 I've also been stealing your packets and bags of sugar crumpSee
[0:44:01] ez2forget: @Chrissy1337 but some kind of timer would be useful as a game mechanic so you know how fresh it was
[0:44:09] StreamElements: Join Snow's Hotbox! https://discord.gg/Snow
[0:44:21] Bionic_Devil: its just a grind and has been quiet for pd which is good but at the same time it will help for training

[0:44:36] Chrissy1337: that sounds kinda unimmersive if it was a plain timer ez2forget
[0:44:49] TomatoPhalanges: @Chrissy1337 as a cop-only viewer it seems like cops are at least like 2 or 3 steps behind crims in IC knowledge and that's fun
[0:44:49] BluGiant: LUL
[0:45:24] TomatoPhalanges: (i have no idea how true that is)
[0:45:27] ez2forget: @Chrissy1337 could be adjectives that describe the state of the blood rather than an actual timer, glossy, dried, etc

[0:46:12] MAXATAK: Chrissy1337 it could have an indication of how dry it is or something, doesn't necessarily have to be a flat timer, there are some interesting ideas that could be explored there, but yeah
[0:46:21] BluGiant: o7
[0:46:21] Brettley67: Sounds like im listen to Starsky and Hutch :D
[0:46:21] MAXATAK: a flat timer would be bad
