[7:14:06] DariusTheYeti: your better of doing a pour over tbh you over extract easily with the French press better tasting if you limit the amount of liquid that comes in contact with the coffee grounds.
[7:14:26] xghosstt: to make your fresh press coffee 10x better, i would get a electric tea kettle and weight your coffee
[7:14:48] ghutta: aeropress is pretty pog
[7:14:49] gunblade00: detox  and vitimin deficentcy.

[7:16:30] xghosstt: if youy want quick coffee, yeah
[7:16:33] sinscar666: the lighter the coffee roast, the more caffeine. bc during the roasting process, the caffeine is cooked out of the beans
[7:16:45] gunblade00: A caffeine overdose occurs when you take in too much caffeine through drinks, foods, or medications.
[7:17:08] ghutta: na

[7:21:24] gunblade00: would thinkone or two cups a day but then some coffee get more cafine then others.
[7:21:49] JustFusee: Yellow pages?
[7:21:53] charredskin: What about this one?!: https://www.amazon.ca/FEZIBO-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Storage/dp/B08GL9M1S6/ref=cs_sr_dp_2?crid=BHORS6D3PLGB&keywords=standing%2Bdesk&qid=1706596340&refinements=p_72%3A11192170011%2Cp_76%3A3276484011&rnid=3276483011&rps=1&sprefix=standing%2Bd%2Caps%2C175&sr=8-11&th=1

[7:22:01] sinscar666: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewTsMUzZqPY
[7:22:05] DariusTheYeti: so thats 3 double shots of espresso but like 8 cups of instant as instant doesn't have that much caffeine in it
[7:22:05] xghosstt: get one of those
[7:22:10] gunblade00: would think depends ow much your body can handle like if good liver can hanle more then back liver.
[7:22:21] sinscar666: my video is just bill nye talking about nitro cold brew
[7:23:15] sinscar666: i tried to research it for you but i don’t think tim hortins sells blonde roast coffee
[7:23:40] gunblade00: The length of time caffeine stays in the body varies from person to person. Although it blocks adenosine receptors, it does not affect the production of new adenosine molecules. When caffeine wears off, adenosine molecules can bind to their receptors, which can cause sleepiness.
