[0:14:14] frenzymarko: richard
[0:14:15] nintynien: that's richard
[0:14:15] money_moe21: signing him out was scuffed
[0:14:17] jasonquinn2022: he made Cornwood drop all his stuff in the car then because he Touch the gun he got the fine for the gun and kidnapping
[0:14:19] money_moe21: Richard
[0:14:27] nintynien: started hanging with CG in 4.0
[0:14:29] money_moe21: mr k prodigy
[0:14:42] TheViperX2: yeah
[0:15:09] jasonquinn2022: kidnapping a cop is 1440 mins and 40 k fine
[0:15:59] chumbychumby: 1440 minutes is insane that’s literally a day
[0:16:10] chumbychumby: tracker should be a physical item they can drop
[0:16:14] TheViperX2: also a PD gun alone adds 2000
[0:16:19] keikobeans: nice collar
[0:16:21] asila02: 2800 months is crazy ngl
[0:17:02] keikobeans: or they could add a jammer with a minigame too crack the tracker
[0:17:17] keikobeans: that could maybe be a blueprint or sumthin
[0:17:23] chumbychumby: wait cars are 3p?
[0:17:35] tbilisi: honestly, now crim/civ guns are released, pd gun should be lowered
[0:17:53] chumbychumby: he was just aiming in 3p I thought
[0:17:53] titanvol29: Is sound of clip super low?
[0:17:56] tbilisi: the fine/time for it
[0:17:59] jasonquinn2022: that’s what k was saying you kidnap them for RP but if you just shoot him it would be ez but people going around shooting cop is kind of shit Lord stuff but Kidnapping is for rp but you get punished more for try to rp then just shooting them
[0:18:26] titanvol29: Not as much now that you can craft guns
[0:18:30] zaps6666: he also took a gun out of the lock box in the car during this lol
[0:18:39] TheViperX2: Paleto station is not active
[0:18:42] Booyal: I kinda like the idea you said that if say their watch was their blip, and if it's taken it pings and starts a 3-5 min map display like meth runs
[0:18:57] titanvol29: @zaps6666 nah he thought about it but didn't
[0:19:00] jojaha: i think they will lower the charge when there is more than 5 cops on duty
[0:19:03] zaps6666: ok my b
[0:19:03] asha6363: K took 6 guns off cops on one day. So the charge being that high is justified
[0:19:06] money_moe21: it was scuffed
[0:19:07] hakz5: it 100% should be lower now crim guns are out and then just punish lootboxers
[0:19:29] asha6363: Not scuffed just not an operational pd
[0:19:30] nishant1_2: Isn't there a /signout command to sign off duty?
[0:19:36] ixidakonixi: you cant duty off anymore
[0:19:37] Proxiehh: not scuffed only mission row operational
[0:19:39] TheViperX2: The only working station is the main one
[0:19:39] zaps6666: @titanvol29 i was in n out the hole time playing games so just seen a lot of shit
[0:19:41] zaf_playz: @asha6363 ? is even caught with those gun what are you talking about KEKW
[0:19:43] BeckaPurce: no scuff involved
[0:19:57] money_moe21: he was defo stalling because he heard them coming on radio
[0:20:01] titanvol29: @zaps6666 it's all good
[0:20:08] kgenera: sherry already knew about paleto not working
[0:20:09] chumbychumby: that pd is just not open
[0:20:09] asha6363: @zaf_playz I mean the charge it self is to deter from these things
[0:20:12] snowmugs: Don't think that pd station operational
[0:20:16] chumbychumby: you can’t do anything there
[0:20:44] chumbychumby: you can do a command to get on there prob is one to get off tho
[0:20:54] AtteTheBear: Theres not
[0:20:59] AtteTheBear: only dutyon
[0:21:02] chumbychumby: yea
[0:21:05] keikobeans: drink some tea with honey my man
[0:21:06] money_moe21: you don’t have to I’m just stating my opinion because they way he was pushing for charges in pd aswell and claiming he was helping k was a joke
[0:21:08] chumbychumby: it’s for like crashing and shit
[0:21:10] TheViperX2: 100%
[0:21:12] hakz5: that’s what k was saying cops are so protected OOC because admins see shooting or kidnapping cops as bad rp instantly
[0:21:35] asha6363: @money_moe21 Cornwood was right there tbh Slacks fucked up
[0:21:53] chumbychumby: ditch the gun no?
[0:21:53] nishant1_2: There should a device to switch tracker off from cops
[0:21:57] s1mplesuper: wait for it
[0:22:13] shekan123: They removed the T/dutyoff in 4.0
[0:22:36] TheViperX2: its coming
[0:22:45] titanvol29: Crazy how they found pd stuff there
[0:23:17] chumbychumby: why shoot?
[0:23:32] zaps6666: 1 thing is y he sed hands up the shoots half sec later
[0:23:39] titanvol29: Yeah , but think it was only spot they looked, not by car
[0:23:40] money_moe21: if they was gonna shoot I think they should’ve done it straight away
[0:23:50] titanvol29: True
[0:23:52] money_moe21: instead of when his pick up is here
[0:23:54] asha6363: Beric wanted to give him a chance
[0:24:01] nishant1_2: I think they gave him a chance
[0:24:06] Jnaylor36: they shot just because they knew the pickup vehicle was there
[0:24:08] snowmugs: That false hope is fucked
[0:24:14] BeckaPurce: the scuff he referenced is his own assumption 3.0 mechanics is still there
[0:24:16] titanvol29: @asha6363 to go where lol
[0:24:17] shekan123: False hope
[0:24:23] kgenera: they vocalized to surrender no?
[0:24:26] asha6363: @titanvol29 to surrender
[0:24:29] hakz5: give a chance until they’re about to actually escape then murder them KEKW
[0:24:36] barb5l: I think they wont to rp it out.
[0:24:37] frenzymarko: true
[0:24:48] money_moe21: true
[0:24:50] natrakjartan: damed if you do, damed if you dont
[0:24:56] Booyal: I think they didn't from the start cause they didn't know who robbed him til he got a radio back
[0:24:59] TheViperX2: would rather get shot before then a fals escape
[0:25:00] titanvol29: Yeah cause they know he's not gonna surrender
[0:25:07] asha6363: I think he would have been mad regardless tbh
[0:25:10] tbilisi: is there a sop about shooting from cars?
[0:25:15] jasonquinn2022: then he spent 3 hours in interrogation cops where working on a deal for him he was originally give 2000mins and 58k fine but then came back and added another 1000mins and 100k add to it
[0:25:24] AloofMango: if they dont they it would they didnt even let me surrender
[0:25:41] natrakjartan: no i mean how cops play it out. i feal like crims get pissed eater way
[0:25:58] titanvol29: When has K ever surrendered
[0:26:19] titanvol29: Yup
[0:26:20] chumbychumby: did he plead guilty
[0:26:30] AloofMango: also it looked even more bad when he only got gunned down when his pickup just arrived OMEGADANCE
[0:26:32] money_moe21: they treat k different imo
[0:26:41] Daniyelaa: @chumbychumby not guilty
[0:26:50] frenzymarko: for sure but i feel like pd can never be consistent, there is too many people with different personalities
[0:26:58] money_moe21: watch his interrogation
[0:27:05] natrakjartan: i think he gets more leaniency
[0:27:19] kid93: sigh hey swizz and chat clienteDance shotzLit julien14KERMITLUV
[0:27:21] asha6363: K gets 100% more leniency than normal crims
[0:27:25] Sanctusmonday: I agree. It comes off as "he might actually get away.. shoot him now that a car is here". They should just shoot.
[0:27:34] AtteTheBear: Oh yeah that interrigation was a joke, Slacks give K so much leeway for no reason its insane
[0:27:36] redthunder43: If they start giving everyone the chance to surrender, then it's fine
[0:27:42] hakz5: @asha6363 leniency? KEKW
[0:28:04] money_moe21: @hakz5 they taking the piss
[0:28:35] AloofMango: Turner BLUBBERS
[0:28:42] shekan123: Yes
[0:28:43] jasonquinn2022: what made him go off the deep end because He spent three hours interrogation with cops give him a deal for info after 3 hours cops left then added another 1000mins and 100k to after try to come to a deal
[0:28:43] TheViperX2: yes
[0:28:45] frenzymarko: yeah 2800 minutes
[0:28:54] chumbychumby: that’s literally what I said
[0:28:58] chumbychumby: 1440 minutes is a day
[0:29:01] Daniyelaa: 2800 with time served
[0:29:06] money_moe21: killing a cop is less that 100 months but kidnapping or robbing them is 1440 each
[0:29:14] mullybags: 150k fine
[0:29:15] shekan123: Robbing a cop is 2 days in prison but shooting a cop is 40 minutes LUL
[0:29:18] titanvol29: Kidnapping and taking pd equipment more than all the other charges lol
[0:29:19] AloofMango: got 400 min time serverd
[0:29:20] zaf_playz: 2800 minutes and 155k fine
[0:29:31] TheViperX2: PD gun alone was the worst
[0:29:35] asha6363: The big time and fine is to deter people from lootboxing cops
[0:29:40] tbilisi: it was mainly cop gun
[0:29:45] asha6363: K legit stole 6 pd guns in few hours
[0:29:45] AloofMango: 1 year 100k
[0:29:48] nintynien: pd gun is 1440 minutes and 100k fine
[0:29:50] redthunder43: 1440 and 100k
[0:29:50] money_moe21: 1440
[0:29:51] Daniyelaa: 100k
[0:29:52] iraffis: 100k fine 1 year in jail
[0:29:53] frenzymarko: 1440 minutes just robbing
[0:30:05] chumbychumby: bruh
[0:30:08] titanvol29: But he wasn't trying to steal it.
[0:30:10] zaf_playz: he got charged possession of pd gun because of DNA
[0:30:11] AloofMango: i meant 1 day
[0:30:11] Daniyelaa: yeah k stole 6 of them in one day lol
[0:30:13] nintynien: kidnapping a cop is 1440 and 40k fine
[0:30:19] Jnaylor36: 1440 for robbing a cop and 1440 for pd weapon possession
[0:30:24] nishant1_2: I think it was when people were loot boxing cops
[0:30:26] shekan123: He said he just gonna kill them now
[0:30:34] money_moe21: he was kidnapping for to reasons not for just anything he was given a job
[0:30:37] jasonquinn2022: so now he said he just going shoot them
[0:30:37] zaf_playz: no he didnt he got charged possession of pd gun because of DNA
[0:30:40] AtteTheBear: If hes not trying to steal it, then leave it on the ground where he kidnapped Cornwood OMEGALUL
[0:30:44] FaustoSousa_PT: 1440 months was for robbing cornwood. he only had the phone on him
[0:30:57] shekan123: He didn't have it, they found it in water and it had DNA on it
[0:31:15] mullybags: he got separate charges for robbing cornwood and possession 1440 minutes each
[0:31:41] titanvol29: He's not wrong lol
[0:31:49] shekan123: Facts
[0:31:53] Daniyelaa: facts
[0:31:54] hakz5: @swizzmb https://clips.twitch.tv/CrepuscularAmusedDonkeyOpieOP-vMzSSm9pTuvQ8B3i
[0:32:15] AloofMango: L clip
[0:32:21] jay_jaymann: or have the cop put the gun somewhere so you never touch it
[0:32:21] shekan123: Shooting is better cause extending the rp gonna get you fucked
[0:32:23] AloofMango: so much empty space smh
[0:32:23] chumbychumby: it’s def just to not let guns get pumped into the server via lootboxing cops
[0:32:33] kid93: :(
[0:32:35] frenzymarko: yeah dna fucked him
[0:32:42] OzzyTheArchitect: Ramee went to jail yesterday cause of scuff and K went to jail today cause of scuff
[0:33:01] AloofMango: @OzzyTheArchitect what was K's scuff?
[0:33:02] tbilisi: think dna is ok because it combats the throw shit out of car meta
[0:33:04] titanvol29: Yeah there's a blanket charge for kidnapping that includes pd equipment and separate one for possession of pd equipment
[0:33:05] frenzymarko: he is saying there is no way to combat that situation, if he for example wore gloves he would be fine
[0:33:06] HEGGA: I guess that he wants to be able to scrub the gun, maybe gloves help or something of that sort
[0:33:08] hakz5: it’s so OP
[0:33:09] Methuzila: no way to combat it
[0:33:10] musical_ocean: The ability to remove it?
[0:33:11] chumbychumby: he means if it’s not a complete match
[0:33:11] TheViperX2: It should be a way to counter it
[0:33:17] mak_kitak: Too powerful no?
[0:33:19] asha6363: @ozzythearchitect The sign off is not scuff that pd is not operational
[0:33:20] itsbanana1107: ha wants there to be crim gloves or something like that to combat dna
[0:33:20] titanvol29: DNA even wearing gloves
[0:33:22] Fishnet83: Hmmm
[0:33:29] clutchthose: Wass gud @swizzmb and chat hope you all doing well swizzmHeart
[0:33:31] chumbychumby: it’s like 12 characters and it can be like less then 12 and cops match it
[0:33:32] hakz5: Cornwood was talking about taking Ramee DNA off a hamburger to charge him wtf
[0:33:32] shekan123: He's saying in general things are being added without testing
[0:33:34] kgenera: dna is just to balance the throwing stuff, but no way to know IC
[0:33:34] BeckaPurce: there is… don’t touch things
[0:33:36] HEGGA: It does
[0:33:40] AtteTheBear: It does
[0:33:40] chumbychumby: Like it degrades
[0:33:41] Daniyelaa: it does
[0:33:42] musical_ocean: It does
[0:33:47] natrakjartan: it eoes
[0:33:54] Jnaylor36: dna lasts 30 days
[0:33:57] musical_ocean: 30 days
[0:33:58] jasonquinn2022: if ramee runs up to you and hands you a pd gun your dna is on it
[0:34:01] money_moe21: I understand your pov but that time is just ridiculous for rp let’s be honest
[0:34:04] asha6363: it says if it us fresh or not
[0:34:09] TheViperX2: Thats too long
[0:34:10] jurefetsu: its inconsistant, sometimes it shows up sometimes it doesn't
[0:34:11] jay_jaymann: it’s hard in irl, even if you warring gloves you can sneeze or drop a hare.
[0:34:12] tbilisi: not 30 days
[0:34:25] Shmicko: Shmicko subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:34:26] 666bluedevil: 666bluedevil subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:34:38] AloofMango: also it says whether dna is old or is it fresh
[0:34:41] shekan123: Yeah people who try to extend the rp get fucked more
[0:34:42] s1mplesuper: also there is literally nothing in prison
[0:34:46] hakz5: and someone can forcefully just pass you a gun and it’s o7 you can’t even combat it in game
[0:34:51] Booyal: i think the real takeaway is if you're kidnapping a cop just get them to throw their shit rather than steal it LUL
[0:34:52] jay_jaymann: dna on nopixel degrades daily to it becomes less of a match so I think it’s pretty good
[0:35:03] AtteTheBear: They cant
[0:35:08] TheViperX2: you cant
[0:35:09] shekan123: You can't
[0:35:11] money_moe21: plus they gonna cry now when ks out in two days and start killing them
[0:35:12] Daniyelaa: you can’t
[0:35:12] AtteTheBear: DNA only shows up if you drop or throw something
[0:35:17] asha6363: No the dna is only if you pick it up from the floor
[0:35:18] kgenera: handoffs have no dna
[0:35:19] zaf_playz: so now people gonna shoot pd instead kidnapping no ?
[0:35:20] jasonquinn2022: Letter of the law possession is possession
[0:35:39] OzzyTheArchitect: That’s why K tried planting a gun on a paralegal that prosecuted him but it didn’t work
[0:35:46] AtteTheBear: Its literally there to combat the whole throwing shit out the window/dropping stuff in the bush during a chase
[0:35:47] titanvol29: He kept hot gun knowing what charges and keeping storyline going, then gets screwed from crazy times. He could've just dumped it
[0:35:49] AloofMango: yes
[0:35:51] shekan123: Yes
[0:35:52] zaf_playz: gun was hot as fuck he never get caught with that gun @SwizzMB
[0:35:52] titanvol29: Yeah both
[0:35:53] jurefetsu: ahye
[0:35:56] jurefetsu: and they stack
[0:35:59] shekan123: Separate
[0:36:06] shekan123: So 2 years
[0:36:08] jay_jaymann: yep both they stack
[0:36:13] zaf_playz: gun came back to 5 different incidents
[0:36:13] Daniyelaa: they stack
[0:36:36] nintynien: i'm pretty sure the council voted to increase the time and fine to this amount too
[0:36:43] Daniyelaa: very
[0:36:48] TheViperX2: the hot gun was notting
[0:36:49] AloofMango: yeah sani robbiers, shooting doctors and judges
[0:36:52] CNCJase: what’s up big mig
[0:37:00] money_moe21: he had a hot gun from 5 incidents and all of that is less than one charge
[0:37:04] s1mplesuper: already on it swizzmKEK
[0:37:10] sabinale123: 1 judge 1 docter 🤣🤣
[0:37:16] shekan123: Hot gun was nothing,  those 2 days fucked him
[0:37:17] TheViperX2: @nintynien K already knows
[0:37:18] jay_jaymann: very hot,  5 incidents of 2nd degree and leo
[0:37:19] rubyn0odle: too be fair, he robbed 6 cops for guns!
[0:37:22] hakz5: @swizzmb K got pardoned day as well so he’s extra pissed
[0:37:27] hakz5: yday*
[0:37:39] ann_canada: DNA is way too OP and this is Grand Theft Auto Criminal aspect I have always found most entertaining.
[0:37:39] titanvol29: Thing is council set those times and fines not crane or state.
[0:37:52] adobokimchi: yup
[0:37:58] Anevoker: https://clips.fxtwitch.tv/IcyPiercingBobaChefFrank-n_IcXqsfnwtJ5l6Q lol
[0:38:03] hakz5: Yhh you not wrong tbh and he was doing it with Z team icl
[0:38:03] AtteTheBear: Its not 30 days
[0:38:07] shekan123: Blood on scene was better!
[0:38:11] money_moe21: cornwood pushed hard on charges and also called a judge while infront of k
[0:38:12] kiri_nz: Did you see the gun that lumber union got caught with?
[0:38:17] tbilisi: dna washesh off after tsunami
[0:38:21] AtteTheBear: It turns in to a partial after a few days AFAIK
[0:38:22] kgenera: DNA’s only for the throwing stuff and dropping things
[0:38:23] jasonquinn2022: ramee got fuck for scratched off gun cops can still Track it, even though it’s a scratched off gun
[0:38:24] tbilisi: its not 30 days
[0:38:26] Kenty90: Needs some counter like water washing it off
[0:38:32] Fishnet83: nikezFat
[0:38:33] OzzyTheArchitect: Does this mean hell week? or what would cause that cause I’ve seen Mr K reallyyyy ‘upset’ lately
[0:38:39] jay_jaymann: by 2 weeks it would only get a 30% match so not enough to convict
[0:38:47] money_moe21: he shoulda f8 and took a 3 day would been the same thing 😂
[0:38:58] AloofMango: @money_moe21 it wouldn't
[0:38:59] hakz5: it’s just annoying you can’t counter dna, ballistics, police trackers odds are so stacked
[0:39:04] nintynien: @Anevoker here's the twitch link for this https://clips.twitch.tv/IcyPiercingBobaChefFrank-n_IcXqsfnwtJ5l6Q
[0:39:05] AloofMango: it's not the same thing at all

[0:39:19] Anevoker: @nintynien ty ty DAP
[0:39:19] nintynien: yeah this is ramee's crash
[0:39:23] itsbanana1107: maybe it can fade a number every 3 days
[0:39:25] shekan123: @aloofmango i would! At least i wouldn't get 150k fine lol
[0:39:29] Daniyelaa: KEKW
[0:39:35] hakz5: Yhh he got fucked as well KEKW
[0:39:38] s1mplesuper: taco’s pov of this is crazy
[0:39:38] TheViperX2: teleporting local

[0:39:52] kiri_nz: https://youtu.be/cSLw8wrQfqw?si=GC8aTqOGqhiDlsQm this the LU gun
[0:39:57] Jnaylor36: tacos pov to this is 10x better
[0:39:58] harut0haru: I think gloves should be the thing, like some bp or some. Cuz you have blood already, if you fucked up on scene it's on you, but you should have some against DNA on items
[0:39:58] clutchthose: rameeStare
[0:40:07] sabinale123: Taco pov
[0:40:08] pacostac0s: it was invisible for taco lol
[0:40:09] jasonquinn2022: taco pov car is not even there
[0:40:11] OzzyTheArchitect: We know you would
[0:40:24] ann_canada: brutal part after negotiating for 3 hrs he ended up with 25% more in time and fines than was first discussed.
[0:40:28] sabinale123: See taco pov
[0:40:35] sheikhy: I think gloves leaving a partial would be cool
[0:40:51] shekan123: You gotta see Taco pov
[0:40:53] phi1__: There was a cleaning kit in 3.0
[0:40:55] OzzyTheArchitect: What about DNA cleaning kits?
[0:40:57] itsbanana1107: maybe if they find the gloves they can run them
[0:41:02] zaf_playz: @shekan123 share it
[0:41:03] harut0haru: @sheikhy ++
[0:41:07] nintynien: crazy fingerprint
[0:41:16] tbilisi: like how dna is 123-456-789 but gloves make it 123-xxx-789 so only partial match @swizzmb
[0:41:18] Markzyy: thats not too bad
[0:41:21] money_moe21: mr k will roll with the time and consequences but when he starts killing pd they just cry

[0:41:52] Shmicko: partial match
[0:41:54] clutchthose: That would be cool
[0:41:56] titanvol29: Yup
[0:41:57] clutchthose: Yea
[0:42:01] harut0haru: Yea
[0:42:13] jay_jaymann: it may already be like that I’m not sure anyone knows yet
[0:42:21] Markzyy: difference between DNA from a gun and DNA as in blood on scene though. so too hard to distinguish the dif i guess
[0:42:21] chumbychumby: could pass crazy legislation about wearing gloves
[0:42:26] itsbanana1107: maybe they get 90% and they know who it is just can't charge if its the only evidence
[0:42:34] phi1__: The cleaning kit in 3.0 was super slow and expensive
[0:42:36] chumbychumby: they aren’t shy ab crazy legislations
[0:42:44] AtteTheBear: Its kinda crazy to me people already thinking of ways to combat DAN when theres only 2 actions that add DNA onto an item
[0:42:49] clutchthose: Damm
[0:42:51] ann_canada: why is the clip so quite?
[0:43:29] nintynien: this is the lumber union pd gun
[0:43:39] YungSammichRS: this is the gun that was on the luber guys after you smoked them
[0:43:43] zaf_playz: gun ramee gave to lumber guys

[0:53:59] kiri_nz: I think they forget that they left the city for like 6 months and you guys made other connections
[0:54:06] itzGilBi: nodd
[0:54:10] money_moe21: that what k said to him
[0:54:33] money_moe21: k said stop bitching to him basically
[0:54:36] hakz5: this gonna be hella unpopular opinion but CG lowkey fell off hard in 4.0 imo
[0:55:18] yourmothersman: CG and Hydra is slow burn and could go either way its fun
[0:55:46] iraffis: Man i feel like someone is selling in your turf

[0:57:41] clutchthose: Gg >besties
[0:57:43] hakz5: @jnaylor36 not fall off in like RP terms I mean like gang wise, it feels K and Ramee have to carry so hard cas no one else does anything
[0:57:57] hakz5: issue with CG is so many people don’t wake up anymore and they’re such key members
[0:58:47] yourmothersman: @hakz5 peanut has been pulling his weight tbh
[0:59:25] hakz5: @yourmothersman Yhh I like him but he’s also hella reckless
[0:59:26] martymagoo78: just means cypress are pushing faster today i guess
[1:00:53] yourmothersman: @hakz5 Cg have always been reckless tho
[1:01:46] hakz5: @yourmothersman nahhhh you’re crazy CG was like a military they were crazy well drilled
[1:02:07] dripydryp: CG has Peanut and Zaceed
[1:02:16] dripydryp: they are definitely Demons
[1:02:24] yaboixgg: Pushed to 50% without any conflict

[1:05:25] loxee88: @yourmothersman scuff both times
[1:05:35] hakz5: @yourmothersman that’s my point CG hella fell off in 4.0 when Richard and Chris are in your main core
[1:06:01] Divineefeminine_: anyways moving on
[1:06:20] Divineefeminine_: i hope everyone is having a lovely day
[1:07:09] notaan: you too divine peepoFlower

[1:08:44] tbilisi: cypress super busy during eu with speedy and his snr buns crew
[1:08:51] Maxverine: @notaan meow
[1:08:56] nintynien: X plays less since there's no progression rn, but still comes around
[1:09:05] hakz5: nahh he’s bored af
[1:09:07] jasonquinn2022: he comes on hang with cg for like 5 hours then dips
[1:09:41] yourmothersman: X with Cg probably wont last but he does hang with them alot
[1:09:54] nintynien: if it's whoever pushes the most, that's what it will come to, right? if a group can do an app with 10 pushers, they will always push more/win
[1:09:57] sleepypanda1910: ya but you definitely need something like that if you want to be In competition with Cypress
[1:10:04] tbilisi: nah its his only way into heist progression so it will last imo
[1:10:23] giibby32: @yourmothersman not with the limit of crime you can do in the city
[1:10:55] jasonquinn2022: x and ramee feed off each other they be th think the same
[1:11:06] TheViperX2: only one group thats different
[1:11:08] nintynien: i think it's funny how the company is basically a bigger umbrella than CG was in 3.0
[1:11:16] iraffis: At this point wat isn't hydra getting cooked for
[1:11:21] TheViperX2: the company
[1:11:28] snowmugs: LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL

[1:11:43] snowmugs: The company he says LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:11:44] hakz5: the company is basically BSK, Seaside and Rust one huge merge
[1:11:44] Jnaylor36: the company literally merged seaside and rust and added Mickey
[1:11:44] nintynien: rust/seaside/bsk
[1:11:45] combattingjosh: The company is just Rust KEKW
[1:11:46] dripydryp: @yungsammichrs bsk

[1:11:51] YungSammichRS: tru
[1:11:51] giibby32: the company is all three of they gangs lmao
[1:12:10] jasonquinn2022: Company?l is mainly ex rust ex seaside with ott
[1:12:13] Fishnet83: D: gasp
[1:12:22] combattingjosh: Wait, you don't shoot? Sadge
[1:12:35] TheViperX2: @jasonquinn2022 when x was in it

[1:12:52] yourmothersman: @jasonquinn2022 ex bsk too
[1:13:01] dripydryp: x fell off tremendously after he robbed the company
[1:13:18] shekan123: @dripydryp lmao sure
[1:13:26] dripydryp: true
[1:13:27] sleepypanda1910: Truee
[1:13:27] giibby32: @dripydryp there’s really nothing to do as a criminal lol
[1:13:36] kgenera: wait do they charge there extra rent?
[1:13:44] tbilisi: yeah crime is super slow, in 3.0 lower vault already released
[1:13:49] hakz5: I’m hoping with the new work changes we see much more RP
[1:13:56] shekan123: Yeah there's no crime to do
[1:14:01] coubzie: swizzmWave hellooo
[1:14:18] dripydryp: hope the weed game spices things up

[1:14:29] dripydryp: i cant watch civ RP
[1:14:51] movin100: If you push your own strain on other turf doesn't it lower their turf rep?
[1:15:31] SultanNT: morning Swizz & chat sntHeart
[1:15:40] movin100: Idk in theory sounds like a good mechanic
[1:16:27] movin100: How many bags to get to 100 rep from 50
[1:16:40] snowmugs: What is the benefit of 100% tho
[1:17:11] tbilisi: its prob percentage of the 100% turf, so you have pushed 50% of the amount pushed in cypress
[1:17:15] iraffis: This Just a opinion whats stopping you from letting alan try to sing in at someone turf and sell some weed if it worked
[1:17:24] sleepypanda1910: Nothing now, but probably something in future @snowmugs
[1:17:46] dripydryp: yeah try selling in sandy
[1:18:43] movin100: Oh interesting
[1:19:15] snowmugs: Don't you need to buy the turf to sell in it ?
[1:19:31] yourmothersman: do frankie and raul still come around?
[1:19:58] yourmothersman: they so underrated
[1:20:14] martymagoo78: thing is multiple strains selling on one turf selling must help the turf total, no?
[1:20:19] redthunder43: Zaza was in Cypress for a while
[1:20:43] AfroKage_17: Yh
[1:21:07] martymagoo78: so i think Zaza and Scooby goin so hard early gave the Cypress turf such a massive head start its hard for people to catch up

[1:23:12] Derm0n: @coubzie Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:23:14] domantre: pog
[1:23:16] 100rc: it might be total bags pushed in each turf so it could be beneficial to have another crew/strain on forum to boost overall numbers
[1:24:56] martymagoo78: maybe just need to pay a bunch of grunts to go crazy pushing for a week, just allow them to take all the money and no crew cut to see if you can make a dent in the %
[1:25:33] sleepypanda1910: Ya that is the only way to even compete with Cypress or sandy
[1:26:06] martymagoo78: just need to catch up enough of their early start to get it somewhat closer, then can start competing
[1:26:19] CazeyTV: cazeytCheer
[1:26:32] sleepypanda1910: Yes need some hard core pushers
[1:26:49] CazeyTV: going to sleep
[1:26:58] CazeyTV: ready for league
[1:27:02] CazeyTV: in the morning
[1:27:19] martymagoo78: cause you basically need to double their output to catch up, so they can just maintain
[1:27:42] tbilisi: yeah sandy only caught up bc speedy was on holiday
[1:27:48] Shanky_k: League 10mans ??
[1:27:49] jasonquinn2022: 4 people selling for 16 hours straight
[1:28:30] tbilisi: yeah need to hire ppl to do it
[1:28:37] sleepypanda1910: Ya that's why need another HQ to hire people for it
[1:28:41] khaled_5655: Too grindy
[1:28:44] dripydryp: sergio should hire people @swizzmb
[1:28:58] ShrimpOnTheBarbii: do both lol
[1:29:06] sleepypanda1910: Robbing is also limited it will not help long term
[1:29:10] martymagoo78: yeah, if its total volume sold they got such a head start start going hard early
[1:29:11] TerranWarrior: Buddha mentioned that Cypress and Sandy people are pushing 14-16 hour days, whereas Families are normal people doing it for 6 hours a day
[1:29:16] tbilisi: robbing wont bring ur % up, still need to push at the end of the day
[1:29:18] nintynien: hire people to rob other groups -.-
[1:29:34] khaled_5655: @terranwarrior ashlolOK
[1:29:34] 100rc: robbing would slow your progress also
[1:29:57] jasonquinn2022: kj was pushing for 17 hours yesterday lol
[1:29:58] Fishnet83: second monitor watching youtube? Kappa
[1:30:33] sleepypanda1910: Ya definitely
[1:30:35] Krakonator: it was more a push goal to see what he could do...then back off
[1:30:48] martymagoo78: nah, Buddha said in his opinion thats what the sandy boys must’ve been doing to catch up… he has been very clear with his pushers he doesnt want them doing that as they will burn out and he would prefer them to be there pushing less but long term
[1:30:49] 100rc: how is that any different to what kaiba got got for
[1:30:58] Ahhlure: its not the ONLY way to do it. its a more effective but loud way of doing it
[1:32:04] sleepypanda1910: Maybe find their grow farm
[1:32:11] khaled_5655: sntHmm

[1:32:38] alexanderthekinght: Increase heat the longer you cell?
[1:32:39] elitejc01: similar for gun ammo crates do it for weed - if people get it it means they have more product?
[1:33:06] winterskyyyy: damn cypress back to 100%
[1:33:16] martymagoo78: if you’re gonna compete it just needs to be a long term plan, slowly creep up on them over time cause of the head start they got
[1:33:20] hydragang_: police catching the strain would be good but think the police have caught more of your strain than anyone’s
[1:33:25] soleb_xx: look how many ppl sell in sandy too, so many strains. that pushes the rep up
[1:33:41] 100rc: seems to be less heat vs back in the day, every weed run had a response almost

[5:04:59] YungSammichRS: Johnson's firing was rough
[5:05:10] BeckaPurce: there were cops saying they legit felt bad about sending k to jail last night
[5:05:26] SandyAlejandra: Johnson got done dirty
[5:05:37] YungSammichRS: Johnson got fired from the PD
[5:05:38] redthunder43: He got fired
[5:05:38] Sebastian1033: The PD job LUL

[5:06:10] gustavAhhr: OMEGALUL
[5:06:11] BeckaPurce: bait title but I feel his opinion is valid
[5:06:25] Booyal: i don't think it's valid in any way honestly LUL
[5:06:41] Markzyy: yeah title is just assuming as he is no longer cop he has nothing to stream. big bait
[5:07:03] BeckaPurce: I mean he is right to be angry, he sees cops feeling bad for others rp but his is not being thought about
[5:07:09] Booyal: well if it's ooc, he got prio boosted twice in his firing, and messaged OOC by ssaab that he could make a new character and be in the next PD program
[5:07:31] Booyal: if it's IC the guy went and bought civ guns and "got robbed" after there was a PD announcement that it's not a thing
[5:07:48] Sebastian1033: Tbh idk
[5:07:49] sne26_: yea
[5:07:50] BeckaPurce: kind of
[5:07:55] ColieBonez: beric got chief sooo
[5:07:56] rob_pwners: yeah
[5:07:56] redthunder43: Yeah, but I think they'll choose someone from shift 2
[5:07:58] Sebastian1033: i dont keep up with PD stuff
[5:07:58] Booyal: Cazey was hyping her big time for sure
[5:07:58] ColieBonez: yea
[5:08:00] sne26_: but she's shift 3, same with Beric
[5:08:03] Markzyy: i know the captains really like her and she was always good with beric
[5:08:07] arocket25: kems been amazing for PD
[5:08:16] ColieBonez: shes been doin great
[5:08:20] redthunder43: If she moves shifts, she definitely has a good chance
[5:08:22] Markzyy: Beric got told he has to change to 2
[5:08:35] ColieBonez: true
[5:08:41] rob_pwners: shift 2
[5:08:58] Markzyy: They need the CoP in Shift 2.
[5:09:09] itzGilBi: 💯
[5:09:12] Markzyy: if anything its better if the assistant is either shift 1 or 3
[5:09:37] sne26_: she's doing really good on cop tbh
[5:09:39] ColieBonez: yup,... shes a great cop too
[5:09:47] Sebastian1033: Beric switch to Shift 0, but he's paying in Shift 2 mainly @SwizzMB
[5:09:47] ColieBonez: same
[5:09:48] turntablist_mk2: she's a great choice
