[1:56:07] drmenac: self awareness goes a long way
[1:56:11] noturs420320: what Ramee never told Vinny was X didnt pay Ramee for his investment
[1:56:19] drmenac: but I understand having none
[1:56:23] just_enjoy_plz: Everyone stirs the pot, but both Vinny and Ramee are most likely to be punching bag :O
[1:56:41] kiid_chewy: Ramee just likes to instigate lol

[1:57:40] ItsAHazardLife: but did Ramee or X have a say in that first deal to be over?
[1:57:40] rpjohnsonfl: 4.0 been so good so far
[1:57:50] steeltrainx: it’s really not Vinny’s
[1:57:52] drmenac: what lmao
[1:57:52] g_u_yx: vinny benefits from the blueprint

[2:00:31] MyOpinionsHere: No hate :) CG is scummy all around
[2:00:31] ItsAHazardLife: I think it comes down to Ramee not having a say in the deal ending or a say into what "his ROI" shouldve been.
