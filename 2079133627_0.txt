[2:46:20] rmcgowan: Your dad is actually wrong here. He sounds like a nice person, but naive. I don't think he understands just how bad things might get and wants to believe in the decency of the people around him. Except people aren't decent anymore

[2:50:02] DillyDobbs: it is really hard, but it seems like you know what you need to do
[2:50:05] rmcgowan: Yeah, you're in a spot where you are invested, and just picking up and leaving is not remotely trivial
[2:50:05] dume5330: the good thing about the US is you basically can move to an entirely different country culture without immigration
[2:50:09] sievers: Gay panic defense
[2:50:17] desick1: Utah arrests ppl for failing drugs test randomly and says it’s a possession charge.. Utah has crazy laws

[2:50:33] stylzo_: Then do it
[2:50:38] Xerthevia: @ELTanqu3 YOINK, MINE NOW
[2:50:38] ctinker6171: @Corvollo It'a a legal defence that removes the "malice" part of murder, turning it to manslaughter, if you kill someone because you were suprised they were trans

[3:02:53] DillyDobbs: holy shit thats good
[3:02:57] ibruticus: depends if you want to worry about it for a while
[3:02:59] twoeuro: Good thing the Xert the property investor is here
[3:02:59] rmcgowan: I'll be honest, you're going to make more money renting it out
[3:03:00] Machatie: Rent out if possible
[3:03:00] dume5330: keep at least until to settle somewhere
[3:03:00] eborcurean: Still not as much as you'd get selling through a realtor
[3:03:01] Sacher: get rid of it
[3:03:01] Ampathized_: keep it
[3:03:02] rem_oa: Id rent it out see where it goes
[3:03:03] boeiee: Renting it will make selling it later on harder
[3:03:03] atgbliss: sell
[3:03:04] AkuShin_: rent
[3:03:05] Ohtlas: Keep and rent
[3:03:05] aluckynewb: rent it
[3:03:05] ben0809: keep it
[3:03:06] DillyDobbs: Do you want to do the upkeep for renters ?
[3:03:06] Xerthevia: With your interest rate, rent it out its a nobrainer
[3:03:06] soccersurfer: keep it
[3:03:07] Dre_: i would rent it honestly
[3:03:07] spicychickenzz: rent if you can make it work
[3:03:08] Lorddarkwolf: rent is allways consistent money
[3:03:09] Nesrekan: keep it is always smarter
[3:03:09] greatmuta2: Rebt
[3:03:09] Morningstarter: rent it through a company that does rental
[3:03:10] TheWhiteWillow94: renting it would be smart financially but it might cause a ton a stress
[3:03:10] PsychoBKilla: I would try renting first
[3:03:10] captaincameron: rent first
[3:03:10] HotCocoaGamer: Rent it out
[3:03:10] TheMaster99: If you're willing to do the work, rent
[3:03:11] Bro_JaB: rent
[3:03:11] ben0809: keep and rent
[3:03:11] CptApples: rent is smarter
[3:03:12] Isen_Mage: keep it, rent out, if things look at all like its getting worse sell immediately
[3:03:12] Hampasen: i wouldt rent it
[3:03:12] NotToTheFace: Would your mortgage allow renting?
[3:03:12] raeken88: keep and rent
[3:03:12] matt7x7x: it depends if you wanna deal with renters
[3:03:12] shpuddie: thinking selling would be easier but renting migt be overall smarter
[3:03:14] Elendel19: rent that out for sure, that interest rate is insane
[3:03:15] Rex__84: passive income always
[3:03:15] ViolentAkuma: Smarter is to rent it out
[3:03:15] Wardiel_: if you have someone to maintain the rental maybe, pita though
[3:03:16] tigerland06: renting a house is good for passive money, but a headache if you aren't nearby. Just depends on your goals.
[3:03:16] kakka_pylly: keep it as long as it doesn't stress you too much
[3:03:17] FriskiestSpoon: rent cause you're never gonna get an interest rate like that again
[3:03:17] WhiteWolf126: you willing to go through all the paperwrok for renting?
[3:03:17] Sahneee: @TheWhiteWillow94, ^
[3:03:18] FIunkifer: I think renting is a good idea always but dont trust me
[3:03:18] Kabezon: Depends on how much effort you want to have to put in
[3:03:18] SpectreUK: Keep and rent its a safety net incase streaming falls flat
[3:03:19] natrakjartan: sell
[3:03:19] odrin_: 2% interest probably won't be seen again for a long time
[3:03:20] spicychickenzz: use a management company or maybe family can look after it
[3:03:21] awe_rora: that’s a really good interest rate
[3:03:21] BladedBuzzer: smarter is rent in theory but not necessarily better for you personally
[3:03:21] AesoSpadez: renting it can turn into an absolute nightmare
[3:03:21] DillyDobbs: there is a lot to do when your renting the house
[3:03:22] zippybln2: I'd say depends on how much you like the ppl you currently rent the other part out too
[3:03:24] candancejade: have a management company rent it for you
[3:03:26] L4zyb4ssturd: can always sell it later if renting isnt working
[3:03:28] soccersurfer: you want cash flow
[3:03:29] BlightSpeaker26: if you rent you can sell later but its more of a headache
[3:03:29] TheElderOwlbear: Sell
[3:03:29] omnynous: Renting would be better, but much more of a hassle, could you get your family in Utah to manage it?
[3:03:31] ewoudkoster: rent it out and maybe let your sister check now and then if the state of the house is still okay?
[3:03:31] captaincameron: let the renters pay your mortgage
[3:03:32] Stoney_Mahoney: second option, since the house is gonna be worth even more in year
[3:03:32] Vadoctrax: It would continue to appreciate, probably better to rent.
[3:03:32] HotCocoaGamer: Renting it out is the smarter play
[3:03:32] pandacimaho: that's insane, if you feel like it renting is better economically; but if it hurts your mental better to get it out of your hands
[3:03:33] noKaminari: rent it unless you really just want to start over fresh
[3:03:34] footmunched: Rent for a year and see how it goes
[3:03:35] Rover_X_Rover: Yea at least try to rent it out and if it dosne work out you can always sell yeah
[3:03:36] Myki_Cameda: can sell after renting, cant rent after selling.
[3:03:38] Thunamin: keep the rate keep house
[3:03:38] awe_rora: renting gets you (essentially) passive income
[3:03:39] rmcgowan: Renting it out has no short term costs. If it isn't practical you still can sell it on the market and make a nice profit
[3:03:41] Isen_Mage: rent it out and sell the moment things look like they're getting worse either market or legislation wise
[3:03:46] boeiee: idk tennant laws to really know if renting into selling will be good
[3:03:48] Fr0stwav3: keep it and rent, with intentions to sell at any time you feel you need to liquidate nodd
[3:03:52] rem_oa: In my country youd pay too much on owned money if you wouldnt reinvest LUL
[3:03:53] DillyDobbs: Will you have some one local to take care of it ?
[3:03:53] Vadoctrax: A company can handle taking care of it.
[3:03:55] Goldflux: depends if you can be bothered to deal with everything involved in renting it out
[3:03:56] Sonaro8: renting also gives more time for it increase in value even more
[3:03:56] raeken88: passive income is always better than lump sums that run out
[3:04:02] Stoney_Mahoney: ask Lang Kappa
[3:04:07] Bairt_: Hold on to it and think about selling when market spikes at some future point.
[3:04:08] omnynous: Could you get your family in Utah to help manage it?
[3:04:09] AetherMana: Find a good first tenant before you put it out there
[3:04:10] PsychoBKilla: hehe
[3:04:11] Dre_: and if you rent it and let’s say things change in Utah you have a place to come back to
[3:04:12] NotToTheFace: If your going to rent in Washington might as well rent yours here, put it on the market to sell slowly and get more?
[3:04:13] ibruticus: KEKW
[3:04:13] LayndShark: selling without rolling into new home could be taxes
[3:04:14] ben0809: KEKW
[3:04:14] spicychickenzz: KEKW

[3:05:07] PsychoBKilla: tink
[3:05:08] Hobbitbot: plus, if you ever need to, or want to come back.. you have a house as long as you plan it right with the renters
[3:05:09] prozorftw: Hmm
[3:05:09] Hampasen: that was my tought
[3:05:10] dume5330: can always transfer to family
[3:05:11] SpectreUK: Put it under a management company?
[3:05:16] Isen_Mage: that's why the moment a law like that is proposed you sell
[3:05:17] Sufficate: cant your parents take it over maby ?
[3:05:23] Sufficate: om paper that is
[3:05:25] Beta_Vidoh: easy option is to take the money and run
[3:05:26] Vadoctrax: then it could be sold, I don't think they'd seize it.
[3:05:26] AetherMana: Transfer it to your dad/sister
[3:05:26] Chronophylos: you can act on that when it comes to that
[3:05:28] Stoney_Mahoney: sell it for more in a year from now?
[3:05:29] Dre_: you transfer it to your parents
[3:05:29] rmcgowan: I will say this, property law is so heavily enshrined that I don't see that ever being a thing.
[3:05:29] eborcurean: Eminent domain means they have to pay the value of the house at least
[3:05:30] neonishere32: nothings a silly thought with these times
[3:05:30] scivs505: Transfer the ownership to your parents to have them sell it for you
[3:05:31] DillyDobbs: I think you sell it and get away from it
[3:05:32] Sonaro8: couldent your parents take ownership of it on your behalf?
[3:05:36] Sonaro8: then sell it
[3:05:37] TheFightspit: Can you parent help?
[3:05:39] FIunkifer: You sell before that law becomes a reality but hold onto it until then
[3:05:41] ApatheticAplomb: that seems super unlikely
[3:05:44] Elendel19: i think if anything that insane happened it would be a federal thing, a state cant do that
[3:05:45] HotCocoaGamer: I mean you will see it coming and can sell it beforehand.
[3:05:46] footmunched: They wouldn't seize it without compensation
[3:05:47] pandacimaho: that has a chance of happening, but it's a long shot. probably would happen in 5-10 years even in the worst case scenario
[3:05:52] NotToTheFace: You could just sell it normally instead of to a quick cash company
[3:05:53] rmcgowan: Property law is like tree law. It is designed to FUCK OVER anyone who even tries to fuck with it
[3:05:56] Bairt_: If legislation like that ever crops up, you sell it to your dad for $1 or something before the bill passes.
[3:05:57] megamanyvr: You can incorporate yourself. Businesses for more rights sadly
[3:06:06] Jarathin: Then the US no longer a free country
[3:06:14] Myki_Cameda: then you transfer it to your parents/sister to sell
[3:06:18] PsychoBKilla: nodd
[3:06:31] FIunkifer: Just like RP BatChest
[3:06:33] L4zyb4ssturd: just get a clean person to run it KEKW
[3:06:37] HotCocoaGamer: Gotta game the system
[3:06:39] theoddiaz: That's fraud
[3:06:46] ibruticus: transfer the house for $1 nodd
[3:06:52] NotToTheFace: Ngl maybe talk to a lawyer on how to protect yourself from this shit
[3:06:55] AkuShin_: LUL a clean person
[3:06:55] footmunched: Or move it into a shell company
[3:06:55] Chronophylos: btw there are no profit organizations that can help you find a place in another country nodd
[3:07:03] prozorftw: yeh you just gotta get the fuck outta there nodd
[3:07:06] Hobbitbot: I honestly can't see a situation where you can't legally own the house. But should that come to pass, then yeah.. sell it to your dad or a family member you trust for super cheap
[3:07:07] Stoney_Mahoney: sell house for 1 dollar to a friend before the feds come, just like NP
[3:07:31] PsychoBKilla: hugg
[3:07:55] MaffieNZ: extra stuff? give it all to jazz
[3:07:57] iAmCasa_: @chronophylos wat are they called ?
