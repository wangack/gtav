[3:28:26] 3y3i: ngl i thought that said jungle dicks.
[3:28:32] diviin3: He gave away most of his slips as well
[3:28:35] QuenchingTurtle: giving up after 18 hours seems worse than watching the whole 24
[3:28:53] pmoonbuddy: I think he more so just enjoyed chatting and he got Hella subs and follows
[3:28:53] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: imagine, 24 hour pounder runs with zero fuckups

[3:29:12] SwaggieOG: easy
[3:29:13] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: loaaaadddedddd
[3:29:13] MissinMyTeeth: does gomer know about the new police gun charge?
[3:29:23] SwaggieOG: with no scuffs
[3:29:45] brewgamingtv: it's crazy 100k fine man
[3:29:45] jta_lopes: is it 100k now? LULW
[3:29:49] killogic916: 100k and 1 year.. pleasse god make K see senses
[3:29:54] ItsEdBoi_: Its got 4 cop bodies on it too
[3:29:58] Gatorade_Me_Bish: 1 day in jail too
[3:30:00] SwaggieOG: then u get raided
[3:30:03] blazemarley: yee K needs some convincing about thatr
[3:30:03] SwaggieOG: on top
[3:30:07] 0rder613: the best law change is the jaywalking law abolished
[3:30:07] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: don’t take guns out… the only reason there are guns on the street is because of the cops… duh
[3:30:08] MissinMyTeeth: if k gets caught with that he’s screwed. hopefully he listens to whoever tells him
[3:30:13] blazemarley: hopefully they push the like public notice about it tomorrow
[3:30:13] bart_ruckel: K don’t care he has Gomer and Vinny to help with that lol
[3:30:19] blazemarley: cuz thats literally GG
[3:30:19] j0nnyfiver: he just needs to plant it on Mary already and be done with it
[3:30:22] 3y3i: thatd be impossible. you have a whole system fighting against you. incorrect packing slips that ruin a run. locals that were programmed to hate you and cant drive.
[3:30:26] xtylaw: 1 day jail too
[3:30:30] MissinMyTeeth: especially when he doesn’t make any money as it is
[3:30:37] Hey_its_Mady: If K gonna do some crazy shit, he should transfer all his money to you
[3:30:38] ItsEdBoi_: U really should be holding all the investor money tbh
[3:30:43] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: I feel you…
[3:30:44] killogic916: throw away a week of grinding for his own spaztic RP
[3:30:51] daskaputtja: Lol... well with this packer... watch out for those mosquitoes this time :P
[3:30:56] killogic916: kinda greedy if he dosnt put it away as much as i love watching K
[3:30:57] arch_dawg: server needs guns. it’s time. it was fun for a while. starting not to@make sense
[3:31:18] Cruxxiam: Grind RP
[3:31:20] pmoonbuddy: Hey, it makes for grade RP… after the whole Johnson incident, Johnson stream absolutely blew up and is loved
[3:31:20] StreamElements: timmacHI
[3:31:29] pmoonbuddy: Great RP
[3:31:31] zurg816: I wonder why lol Ruth had a jay walking on her record and Mr k found out in the main building thing (where lawyers go) I know he don’t care however I hope the not helping certain people in 4.0
[3:31:41] ccoolracer128: if this is a MMO than it would be cool for the grind but its not lol
[3:31:46] Cruxxiam: I watched a lot of 2.0 Gomer and I loved the Grind
[3:32:10] Splitcookie713: plus the dis tracks are nice
[3:32:11] TheExHarbringer: yeah. its deff easy to burn away all the grind work with a few actions in 4.0 atm
[3:32:20] brewgamingtv: do u think the start is a little slow pace with crim stuff?
[3:32:26] arch_dawg: groups are getting too far along and building into conflicts for their only to be wrenches and knives
[3:32:26] pmoonbuddy: Precisely, the Rangers
[3:32:28] tacos4daysz: I'm here for the grind and the pay off
[3:32:28] 3y3i: idt ive heard a song by danger that didnt slap.
[3:32:35] Splitcookie713: I agree that Gomer should hold the money
[3:32:36] xtylaw: yes
[3:32:39] blazemarley: i mean the 100k change should make K think differently about rolling around with it so much
[3:32:43] brewgamingtv: true
[3:32:46] killogic916: we got over 2 years of 4.0 ahead of us
[3:32:55] LaytLight: Its for the longevity of the server
[3:33:00] blazemarley: but who knows he might now give a fk LUL
[3:33:09] j0nnyfiver: I think once K finds out about the new fine he’ll plant it on someone and be done with it. hopefully lol
[3:33:11] onilaa4: As long as you are personally willing to pay the price of holding a hot gun then so be it. Just unfair if you look to others to bail you out if you in trouble financially.
[3:33:18] fiction12211: can’t wait to see what the do with gta6 and nopixel
[3:33:20] zurg816: I know at some point everything is going to change, however I just wanna see everyone have fun
[3:33:31] apaceboldface: all the learning on new heist is gonna burn butcoin and money
[3:33:32] woodywiththehoodie: Nope
[3:33:35] ItsEdBoi_: Dont think he did
[3:33:39] Gatorade_Me_Bish: No why K stops using that gun LUL
[3:33:40] Blue_Walsh: If they wait too long to implement crime, I feel like they'll turn away all the big streamers they anticipated with the start of 4.0
[3:33:43] Gatorade_Me_Bish: way*
[3:33:51] killogic916: need to put the gun in a bukakae before planting it
[3:33:54] TheExHarbringer: if he cant get it appealed he can have that expunged anyway
[3:33:57] j0nnyfiver: only get swabbed for violent felonies. he should be good
[3:34:01] xxb1gsxx: the new gun laws are awesome imo, makes using a gun and doing crime legitimately (while owning a gun) penalized.

[3:34:18] killogic916: @xxb1gsxx u dont think 30k is a penality?
[3:34:21] Owlman82: banks etc
[3:34:27] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: it’s all a build up
[3:34:29] daskaputtja: I'm actually enjoying this slow introduction of NP 4.0
[3:34:41] arch_dawg: @xxb1gsxx it’s fine to stop cop hold ups. normal guns need to show up
[3:34:51] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: agreed… the speed it’s going is great so far.
[3:34:58] blazemarley: VIBE
[3:35:01] tacos4daysz: pandar79NODDERS pandar79NODDERS pandar79NODDERS pandar79NODDERS pandar79NODDERS pandar79NODDERS
[3:35:05] killogic916: i think guns are real soon with all the new evidence cops got a few days ago
[3:35:06] QuenchingTurtle: if you start off with the big shit, it burns out after a while and theres nowhere up from there
[3:35:09] itsmeebabes: timmacDANCE
[3:35:11] brewgamingtv: i still wonder what the usb is for
[3:35:19] 3y3i: well the issue is there are so many banks and heist. its rinse and repeat too much, the RP around the street deals between everyone is 1000% more entertaining.
[3:35:23] TheExHarbringer: the speed server is at for the growing pains all around is good. since half the laws and governing shit is not even worked out yet
[3:35:45] IClapBarOut: cop and robbers rp is kinda old, nice to see something else to be the main focus
[3:35:59] j0nnyfiver: car boosting and house robberies are probably next to be implemented imo
[3:36:07] pmoonbuddy: TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[3:36:22] ItsEdBoi_: Think they are going for crims robbing civs more, dundee robbing g6 trucks is hilarious

[3:36:35] Splitcookie713: It’s good where it’s at rn for the most part. no guns for a little while longer is cool
[3:36:51] TheExHarbringer: with all the houses, i wouldnt be suprised if house robberies are done to actual people.
[3:36:53] j0nnyfiver: yeah but it gets Chawa back and we miss him lol
[3:36:54] 3y3i: also, why is being on a roof so satisfying.
[3:37:00] dewhicular: LUL
[3:37:10] TheExHarbringer: and gata scope it out for who you gunna rob, and when they arnt at home etc
[3:37:29] Gatorade_Me_Bish: No way, the potential to put someone in 300k debt is way too big to throw way
[3:37:35] brewgamingtv: yeah i would like the racing stuff to actually have RP in it and not just hey good race go next
[3:37:35] StreamElements: timmacHI
[3:37:36] arch_dawg: I love the pacing up to the point that stuff starts to not make sense and drags on the general vibe of 4.0
[3:37:40] brewgamingtv: make stories out of it
[3:37:51] Karizma_x: classic dexx KEKW
[3:37:51] daskaputtja: I'd love to see Dondi come back with a huge story line like what happened in 3.0 or even story lines like that. It was awesome to see it all play out
[3:38:28] KoD_SicKFreaK: the computer stuff seems like its rolling out a bit slow imo, a new app/part comes out every couple days and some stuff if useless until the next thing
[3:38:44] jay1988HD: dex the homie
[3:38:47] pmoonbuddy: How much is turbo upgrade for packer???

[3:40:59] QuenchingTurtle: thats cause gomer is always down for everyone else, what goes around comes around
[3:41:05] blazemarley: its a good spot to be when you got people who can believe/help fund your shit
[3:41:09] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: wasn’t Vinny willing to help… maybe he can find you a turbo
[3:41:10] zurg816: good karma
[3:41:13] blazemarley: invest *

[3:41:36] raalenn: turbo wagon
[3:41:39] cybigil: Now get Chodie so you 2 can double up the money
[3:41:45] zurg816: he would most likely do it too
[3:41:47] killogic916: @daskaputtja MRPD is green zone apparently
[3:41:48] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: “Tax Season Vinny”
[3:41:58] boss_waka: hes waiting for taco rn
[3:41:58] Mordis_: Didn't the boys steal a 97mm Turbo from someones trunk?
[3:42:01] daskaputtja: @KoD_SicKFreaK I think so yes. MRPD is one of those safe zones apparently
[3:42:07] cybigil: That's not what I said
[3:42:18] Lepaca: timmacYAP do this timmacYAP do that timmacYAP

[9:05:56] HebrewOutlaw: yeah like their belongings will already get taken later anyway so what’s the point
[9:05:57] soiledmypantss: it’ll just piss off the crims

[9:07:40] internalin: some cops were throwing economy breaking amounts of money at CIs apparently
[9:08:02] MSif7: I have a feeling it was Eugene
[9:08:12] HebrewOutlaw: @msif7 same 😂
[9:08:20] thebadger1949: @whoneedsbullets I feel if that person shows violent or suspicious activity the instant the first cops show up cause that usually shows Alot tbh
[9:08:26] HebrewOutlaw: it’s always eugene
[9:08:30] MSif7: Eugene seems to be THE Cheese Master
