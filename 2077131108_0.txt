[1:06:34] NewAgeNess: either increase the payout or reduce the butc needed. I like the idea of the heists costing a lot of butc to gatekeep a bit
[1:06:38] Kydoc: i think the issue is the price of circuit boards is inflated to a degree devs didn't inticipate

[3:27:09] TeemSmeek: @jam_a_lam obstruction of justice is when you interfere with the police. eg trying to help someone escape
[3:27:12] JusticeDredd_: check out nopixel.net about joining @tyvpulsedxyz
[3:27:12] BoxFan112: Expunged is like 500k lol

[3:27:44] milllajs: I think it makes sense, that you can't be driving state money around as a felon. But the part that sucks is that it wasn't like that from beginning
