[0:55:10] Skillah10s: heist crews can change like Mickey said.. he wants to invite other people outside of the company for heist crews
[0:55:10] NewAgeNess: The aspect of the company that is fun to watch is it's different from 3.0. It just feels like every iteration of No Pixel feels the same.
[0:55:11] ragamuffen: the company is special man, everyone loves an underdog story
[0:55:12] devinolwell: Yall rob the laundry mat today?
[0:55:12] anonymouse247: early days
[0:55:12] cbjester: The Company should try to find the next great hacker like a Marty or a Sykkuno via the interns. Do a speedt typing/hacking competition or something.

[0:55:44] kswissx: could you ever see you and x doing a heist together in the future?
[0:55:47] B0wmen: i think the company has better vibes as a business/heist crew rather than a gang
[0:55:49] JaiLotus: Timothy would not benefit a group in terms of heists
[0:55:49] blurred1: marlo is a big business guy right?
[0:55:51] bamz5: the problem with the company is you don't let people in anymore, rae tried, timothy tried
