[1:02:16] pointless197: chill pill old, bro. like the 80s
[1:02:22] BearCub504: Hipe hugg
[1:02:25] mimiccephalopod: I like the arguments, dinner and a show
[1:04:18] NinjaMuffin17: I think they miss the arguments
[1:04:19] lordoverlay: What does the wife do exactly?
[1:04:40] Bnooru: She should use other kind of cigarettes
[1:04:48] Bnooru: Tô relax a lil more

[1:05:33] NinjaMuffin17: jbtvWdym be nice
[1:05:35] Mr_Hipe: HUH
[1:05:52] lordoverlay: She needs to be fired.  Doesn't matter if she's a part owner.  Poor professionalism
[1:06:08] daysbyflow: not everything is about ASS
[1:06:12] Bnooru: Omg
[1:06:12] StreamElements: jbtvOMG
[1:06:22] natkubes: !ass
[1:06:22] StreamElements: Jenny has talked about ASS 80 times. wideduckass
[1:06:23] ThetanProof: i think expecting servers to kiss your ass is a big boomer mentality
[1:06:23] natkubes: ass
[1:06:26] daysbyflow: HUH
[1:06:30] Ketheptis: home because of an ice storm, but I had my work laptop...so now I'm stuck working at home
[1:06:32] Feawing: jbtvKill I am smilling
[1:06:34] Bnooru: HUH
[1:06:41] Bnooru: jbtvShy
[1:07:31] UnreachableToast: he is going in on this poor woman
[1:07:37] FeralSnow_: Not the blue NOOOO
[1:07:56] NumberlessUser: do any of these places _actually_ stay open after the end of the show?  Like it seems like every single one, I google and it's just like 'Closed within a year'
[1:09:05] Bnooru: @numberlessuser the burger joint from yesterday is open still
[1:09:05] Feawing: jbtvCheer
[1:09:06] FeralSnow_: @NumberlessUser I think it ended up being a meme that most places ended up closing. Like Gordon coming to your resturant was a curse.
[1:09:44] NumberlessUser: Heh yeah, it sure feels that way.  And I missed the burger one yesterday.. I was still asleep :D
[1:10:03] Mr_Hipe: Punch
[1:10:04] Feawing: jbtvMeeting
[1:10:24] NinjaMuffin17: looooool
[1:10:51] UnreachableToast: i feel like most of these places are almost beyond saving/have issues that are bigger than what a restaurant face lift can fix
[1:12:00] Mr_Hipe: @UnreachableToast true and the problematic people always claim they'd completely change but in reality they only do so until the camera crew leaves
[1:12:29] NinjaMuffin17: KEKW
[1:12:31] Bnooru: He really needs help inside the kitchen
[1:12:39] lordoverlay: She lost her anger (for now).  But just wait until her cigarettes run out
[1:12:52] FeralSnow_: KEKW
[1:12:54] Bnooru: Hahahahahahhahaha
[1:12:56] Mr_Hipe: KEKW
[1:13:12] John_Croft: oneshotHIDE
[1:13:13] HooShKab00sh: Oh shit
[1:13:17] pointless197: true. a lot of the restaurants he goes to fail because they simply  have too much debt and a slight pickup in customers won't keep you open if you have no money
[1:13:23] Ketheptis: this is just a normal kitchen
[1:13:27] augu85: RIPBOZO
[1:13:33] Mr_Hipe: wolfaSadge
[1:13:35] ThetanProof: a seizure holy cow
[1:13:35] Bnooru: Seizure? Jesus
[1:13:35] StreamElements:  Remember to follow the channel or get an extra beating Punch
[1:13:41] UnreachableToast: bro
[1:13:47] Betty_BB: Was Gordon Ramsay in Jenny's kitchen?
[1:14:01] pointless197: wonder if it was a stroke. they can look similiar
[1:14:34] Ketheptis: ooh, I remember this place
[1:14:51] HooShKab00sh: Yea I think the blue was much better than the white. The white looks so drab LUL
[1:15:09] ThetanProof: this show is real good research for griefing in Kebab Chefs
