[2:06:42] Lunar_Delta: Im moving to Switzerland in the future and price of gas is over $7 US so Ill be getting an electric car if I decide I need a car. AAAA
[2:06:45] the_good_neighbor: true story; one of my professors had to cancel a morning class bc his tesla didn't charge in the cold weather KEKW
[2:06:53] OllieOlii: Yep, it sucks so bad
[2:06:53] tabrockstreet: i will never own a car younger than 2010 because of the tech issues
[2:06:54] Mr_AIien: "My software wont update so im stuck here"
[2:07:03] geckoZen: we need trains widepeepoSad
[2:07:10] dbacks5439: @Lunar_Delta Not a lot of places to drive around in Switzerland, so it's a nice trade-off
[2:07:11] Mr_AIien: COOK
[2:07:13] l_buckner: all cars are a pain in the ass
[2:07:17] spuds3432: I was just having this conversation with a friend of mine earlier today lol
[2:07:17] RS_Paul: a friend of mine has a new merc, it has 2 batteries because it's a hybrid, one battery went and the car had to be craned on to the tow truck, £18,000 it cost merc to replace the battery
[2:07:18] boy_pt: @Whippy And the pollution ev's make for theirs batteries is more then and combustion would make over their life time and in like 5 to 10 years the batterie needs to be changed
[2:07:21] Kinson1: @Whippy In the USA, they are trying to make it mandatory that new cars be installed with a remote shut off that the police can use. SURELY that won't be abused!
[2:07:34] Sneaky194: KEYS?
[2:07:43] easykillin187: @kinson1 really?
[2:07:43] EvlCoyot: Dodges get stolen sooooo much in the US.
[2:07:44] Lunar_Delta: @dbacks5439 yeah, I love walkable cities.
[2:07:47] bonepowa: get you a manual caar in US and no one gonna be able to steal it LULW
[2:07:54] shacklyn: @tabrockstreet i have a 2011.  no touchscreen, no backup camera, no blind spot sensors, no power locks, no power windows
[2:07:59] ramzee_d: Better than Kia cars with how easily they're stolen
[2:08:00] bonepowa: in US they are dumbo
[2:08:02] dbacks5439: Keyless are easier to steal because the crims can intercept the signal and use it to start the car
[2:08:17] kilakyle05: 2 factor authentication maybe on them someday
[2:08:18] Sneaky194: I mean you literally steal Keyless cars in 4.0 LUL
[2:08:19] Volanii: @Kinson1 they also want to add Alcohol sensing stuff so if it senses alcohol in the air it wont start at all
[2:08:21] slyoperator: Tesla door handles freezing shut AAAA
[2:08:27] l_buckner: @kinson1 that’d be creepy AF
[2:08:28] Bawlssonic: i thought one of the issues was that it would just roll in to you and make you die LUL
[2:08:31] ramzee_d: Can steal a Kia with a USB cable
[2:08:32] broxh_: i drove my sisters auto and hit the break thinking i was changing gear LUL
[2:08:35] zapciks: what vod is this ?
[2:08:43] tabrockstreet: @shacklyn I understand that not all models had those features, but that is when it all started
[2:08:44] Kingdeathmatch: I remember working for RACQ and getting calls about cars not starting. Get there and it's because they weren't pushing in the clutch.

[2:09:09] whipster453: have you seen the Japanese 10k truck @whippy
[2:09:13] dbacks5439: Just put one of those Apple tags on your car. Easy to track that way.
[2:09:14] shacklyn: @tabrockstreet oh, yeah.  agreed.
[2:09:25] Kinson1: @Volanii Yep ..
[2:09:29] broxh_: very true
[2:09:29] Kingdeathmatch: DSG ftw
[2:09:37] jdotno: I wish my car would get stolen.
[2:09:37] boy_pt: @Whippy you now what is funny about the car having a key fob and not an actual key is that on the 2019 model of the mustang the manual one you can turn on the car and leave the key in your house bc it's manual it can't shut it self off KEKW
[2:09:37] Stealthkillah122: Watch this Sussy

[2:10:42] Jpoc2012: germans love complicated methods
[2:10:43] Galluu_: I once had a throwout bearing separate at the shaft/bearing weld, which threw brake fluid (shared resevior) all over the pressure plate and clutch. Caused the clutch to shred itself. Locked the drivetrain up at 90mph lmao
[2:10:53] romfi: peepoBike
[2:10:58] l_buckner: they’re intentionally making car harder to self maintain
[2:11:14] Lunar_Delta: replaced the throttle body on my 2010 Fusion for $30. Came with the sensor. The sensor was the issue.
[2:11:16] Volanii: @Galluu_ oh wow
[2:11:19] ExessiveGK: gmc did that with a series 3 3600 engine where it has no upper throttle body it's all electronic
[2:11:20] Nomad_Ninja: you talking about the IAC?
[2:11:33] Inquisitor66: @Nomad_Ninja he is talking about vanos
[2:11:43] chaosgeek1: It's deliberate, is what it is. They don't want yopu to be able to fix things easily on your own car so they can have you use their garages and spent tons of money on simple repairs they made impossibl;e to do
[2:11:56] Nomad_Ninja: IAC = Idle Air Controller
[2:11:58] Galluu_: @Volanii if I can hunt down the pics when I replaced it, Ill post them in the discord, but that was 10(?) years ago.

[2:14:24] whipster453: screw convertibles   T-TOPS is where it’s at
[2:14:28] l_buckner: @volanii need a manufacturer to start making cars specifically for self maintenance, there’s a market for that but it isn’t happening
[2:14:31] DeusVexis: leaky seals on soft tops nothing better
[2:14:32] noahdienekes: my car looks like mercedes from back and bentley from the front

[2:15:08] whipster453: I love t-tops an flip up headlights their the best
[2:15:13] boy_pt: There is big problem with 2022 Citroen c3 is the distribution pully (idk how it's spelt in english) is bathed in oil so after 15k kilometers they would disintegrate and brake the motor so there was a time where all the cars that came in the shop where to change that to the new on that didn't go to shit
[2:15:16] kilakyle05: @ramzee_d 🤣🤣🤣 right?!
[2:15:44] chaosgeek1: @T3r3nceSkill yes he has a warrant. The cops actually tried to pull him over when he was riding on a mountainbike, but D went into the hills and lost them
[2:15:53] slyoperator: BLUBBERS the PD
[2:15:58] tabrockstreet: @boy_pt was it nylon?
[2:16:03] Inquisitor66: @boy_pt there are fords driving around with timing belts that go inside of the oil pan of the car and rubber residue from the belt clogs the oil pick ups and kills the engine
[2:16:08] nummento: there really isnt gang turf idek what eugene means
[2:16:11] slyoperator: How could the crims do this Madge
[2:16:16] Nomad_Ninja: @whipster453 lol, its too bad they're the worst for aerodynamics and fuel efficiency lol
[2:16:28] SuperKoorie: might have been something to do with an oil tanker explosion?
[2:16:32] Lunar_Delta: whats the new highway speed limit? I dont remember

[2:16:55] romfi: peepoDetective
[2:17:07] boy_pt: @boy_pt no it wasn't i think it was bc of the thickness of it but the cars where basically new and the motor could go to shit in no time
[2:17:12] Lunar_Delta: @Nomad_Ninja Had to be higher than that. The backroad limit is 75
[2:17:23] boy_pt: @boy_pt yes it's that
[2:17:34] romfi: AAAA
[2:17:37] SuperKoorie: to the billy! na na na ana na naa
[2:17:47] boy_pt: @boy_pt but worse bc it was disintegrating
[2:18:03] jdotno: There are also fords that have a shitty timing cassette that sits in a location where oil drains away from when off, so after about 100,000 miles they sieze up.
[2:18:10] noahdienekes: whens mini Dundee waking up???
