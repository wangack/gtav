[12:15:23] Div_the_Penguin: so like houses but a heist version ?
[12:15:27] 3spada_Grande: So pretty much like GTAO heist
[12:15:30] Riuzaku: I wish you could use the drill or some of the stuff you can already buy for something
[12:15:31] tombovard: maybe reintroduce store cameras to the vault then for police to be able to check KEKW
[12:15:35] Tsorer: moon2Y FeelsStrongMan
[12:15:38] itsmecurkz: PAPA uhnKiss
[12:15:47] nnsLUL: its impossible to balance
[12:15:50] ssunshien: true
[12:15:52] Div_the_Penguin: yeah
[12:15:53] Klax04: so what, less hostage taking
[12:15:59] Rellies: DW has started doing GTAO-like heists in his recent robberies which i think is fuckin cool
[12:16:00] M_C_Lovin: yup
[12:16:00] superpat50: yeahhhh..... truuuuuuuu
[12:16:00] stukamod: no
[12:16:02] ACDC_Shane: uhnHello
[12:16:02] wondervviener: maybe the silent route is more expensive
[12:16:05] PolarShip: !nostalgia
[12:16:05] Nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/FriendlyGoldenQuailPastaThat
[12:16:06] wutangstyle613: X is incapable of silent approach ....
[12:16:07] Falling_Pelican: reckless is 5 times payout
[12:16:07] tombovard: might need a cooldown for that ultra silent approach
[12:16:10] TheRarePotato: maybe it's RNG silent
[12:16:11] Riuzaku: the blow up approche would be cool
[12:16:13] Tsorer: @terpz_xyz yes, we dont care :)
[12:16:14] Ven_the_Red: No, everyone collectively forgot about it
[12:16:15] wavothan: thats the crux of everything, balance
[12:16:16] Klax04: plenty would for the chase
[12:16:18] Nochaa: rng factor maybe?
[12:16:23] Sliptrixx: Silent should have lesser payout
[12:16:25] Riuzaku: bomb it NODDERS
[12:16:25] 9erwyn: Probably if it needs more dongle to do silent
[12:16:25] Olacarn: What about hitting it silently gives less rewards than a full bang up job?
[12:16:30] Rellies: could also do like a Story Intro Mission in GTA5
[12:16:30] kikalos12: cg would prolly
[12:16:32] Delfryngr: NODDERS
[12:16:33] Div_the_Penguin: imo the reckless approach should give as much but have more cops
[12:16:35] isDall: reckless should have higher payout cause you'll probably have more charges
[12:16:40] xiangkekleo: Did Nino just poof?
[12:16:46] wutangstyle613: Jean Paul would never be able to keep silent LUL
[12:16:54] almostdps: wtf
[12:16:54] adobokimchi: LMAO WTF
[12:16:55] Tru7hyDv8: Wtf
[12:16:59] dipzyisarmed: i mean if hitting it silently, means lower vault difficulty, I'd guess people would rather go exploding.
[12:17:03] adobokimchi: was that magic or what
[12:17:03] dank_memes_kid: I was about to say is that a small amish buggy but I realized its a bike next to trashcans lol
[12:17:07] Klax04: they need to do something about hostages first, back to too many getting taken and people getting sick of it
[12:17:08] Tsorer: LUL
[12:17:09] tombovard: what if they bring in the Payday drill minigame, where it's a low skill, long duration minigame that anyone could do KEKW
[12:17:14] EvidentlyNova: The way it works in GTAO is if you hit it silently doing it silently again would be harder so it encourages you to be reckless for easier time hacking etc.
[12:17:18] ACDC_Shane: Went to sleep right after “One shot” Chris called. Did I miss any jobs?
[12:17:30] Bombchuuu: @ACDC_Shane nah

[12:17:49] ACDC_Shane: @theregu758 Damn thanks
[12:17:49] Riuzaku: @klax04, being a hostage for the vault must be the worst. 1 hour just standing around and at some point all 4 robbers just vanish
[12:17:51] symptms: so chat, WHO is this One Shot Chris?
[12:17:53] lostmyoldaccount123: You missed one shot chris's job. Depending on which phone call
