[0:27:51] Hey_its_Mady: A rack full of new GPUs is 50 butc investment + all the mats required to build those GPUs. A very hefty investment just to produce +2 butc
[0:29:06] toroross0: and is there a limit of contacts you can hire?
[0:29:13] marius_mac10: shotzSip
[0:29:13] R3dl1nes: oof for the company then when the power bill comes hehe
[0:29:27] doktou: what does booster do
[0:29:31] appleceee: its smarter to make like 5 new racks and fill them with Old GPU'S and switch the gpu's out slowly instead
[0:29:33] toroross0: I assume you can pick 1 of 3
[0:29:39] THEgoodCOW: @doktou no one know
[0:29:48] doktou: yup
[0:29:49] ItsEdBoi_: @Hey_its_Mady Its less than 50 u get 2 or 3 per BP, so its really 17 or 25 btc for full rack

[0:48:29] Hey_its_Mady: You should delete the upper layer room
[0:48:56] R3dl1nes: i guess :D
[0:48:59] ItsEdBoi_: could prob just do floors
[0:49:10] sickbound: someone said the rooms need walls and doors too? might be scuffing shit

[0:52:21] appleceee: i think the room is just for organizing everything in to a folder so u can collapse and open on the furniture list
[0:52:42] Vngi: Does ctrl click not let you highlight more than one?
[0:52:55] BiGGHydro: kebunNoted very thins walls
[0:53:04] Lepaca: timmacGOMER "Keep it down out there, and get off my lawn!"
[0:53:47] rambosweetz: LUL
[0:54:04] ItsEdBoi_: @appleceee Believe its for loading purposes aswell, the way someone explained it loads based on linked rooms, so 1st room will load 2nd then when u enter 2nd it will load the 3rd and so on
[0:54:12] marius_mac10: @timmac I feel sorry for you, if I had to edit all this shit I would have an aneurism

[0:57:21] RisKkeyy: Bro this second level is crazy expensive with all those little wall pieces
[0:57:24] Azzarill: or is it LVL 1 so it loads ?
[0:57:46] DESHAWNTE: did the power bill come yet?
[0:57:46] doktou: call ray romanov he can help you
[0:58:16] R3dl1nes: that way the stairs and floors aways the frist to load
[0:58:18] Lepaca: @doktou how does Gomer know that?
[0:58:18] ItsEdBoi_: Wonder if the entrance is counting as the 2nd floor and thats why ppl fall through
[0:58:44] ItsEdBoi_: idk it might be

[1:02:15] Vngi: does it not let you drop it inbetween the ones already in the house dummy rather than dropping it onto it?
[1:02:24] skaiixd: actual hero
[1:02:26] appleceee: delete some of the  random flooring and it'll get added to ur inventory, could use it for something else
[1:02:36] Lairend: looks like ur orginzing them in the list? just got here whats it suppose to do
[1:03:14] Lairend: ooooooo ok

[1:03:58] jwwwl: anyone know why k didn’t stream yesterday?

[1:40:39] irishmf_24: Entrance
[1:40:40] ItsEdBoi_: I would just leave it
[1:40:47] sickbound: spawn point in basement
[1:40:49] darkdemonwiz: you can leave it not in a room it will just always load
[1:40:50] Wudhed: what kind of panel
[1:40:51] Azzarill: U need it to change ?
[1:40:56] sickbound: or that
[1:40:58] marrinho24: Leave it, easy to change clothes
[1:41:01] Azzarill: basment
[1:41:02] Skrimzee__: basement
[1:41:02] modals0l: in the basement
[1:41:04] Mordis_: Basement
[1:41:06] irishmf_24: Spawn is basement
[1:41:06] suijay: spawn point is the dude
[1:41:08] Azzarill: no k did it
[1:41:12] ItsEdBoi_: Click save before doing anything else
[1:41:13] miahsix: no he had to place it
[1:41:16] irishmf_24: No you can choose where to put it
[1:41:17] altoidstin1: should be somehwere where the call cops button can easily accesed
[1:41:18] Morph_: 2nd
[1:41:22] sturg2k5: think k has to do that
[1:41:22] ItsEdBoi_: Think u put in basement
[1:41:24] Morph_: you can move it wherever you want
[1:41:24] apaceboldface: it the guy standing
[1:41:26] irishmf_24: It's that dude in the basement
[1:41:28] Dieson75: K had to move it to basement
[1:41:29] HunterKrown: its the guy that you see in the basement
[1:41:33] malanQ: yeah but the boys won’t go down every time the need to change LUL
[1:41:37] nova_rubio: I think it’s at the entrance because K wanted to be able to change outfits right away when entering the house
[1:41:38] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: type spawn
[1:41:41] Skrimzee__: no he set it there because it was up top but when you logged in, you would fall cause none of the floors would load sometimes
[1:41:41] sickbound: thats spawn
[1:41:42] Azzarill: thats the spawn
[1:41:45] Wudhed: Keep change clothes next to entrance for ease of access
[1:41:50] Hey_its_Mady: Thats the spawn
[1:41:56] etpr21: k put it in the basement cause is the only way you don’t die when spawning in the house
[1:41:57] irishmf_24: When loading into the house basement is the safest cause you fall through the floors
[1:42:16] ItsEdBoi_: Think keeping it out of folder might be best cause then they should always load yea?
[1:42:34] DrCached: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:42:40] Azzarill: HE only did it cos you fall through floor ?
[1:42:49] sickbound: no idea
[1:42:50] darkdemonwiz: void is outside
[1:42:50] Mordis_: No clue

[2:02:30] Azzarill: Lang messed up trying to fuck butc prices lol
[2:02:37] deivdeivdeiv: racks are not full of gpus either
[2:02:44] Krabby__Patty: have you made the better gpu's yet?
[2:02:52] ItsEdBoi_: need a rack and a half or better gpus
[2:02:53] marrinho24: better GPU as well
[2:03:12] Kdkuiper: should do the new gpus on the new rack
[2:03:19] Azzarill: are new gpu worth it ?
[2:03:23] ItsEdBoi_: And thats if u wanna do all 3 contacts, maybe u might just do 1
[2:03:31] modals0l: upgraded gpu into the computer
[2:03:34] CommanderKilroy: 13 a day?
[2:03:37] Gangstajoka: One best gpu can be used for the computer
[2:03:48] CommanderKilroy: Just do that, puts you at 91 a week
[2:04:04] RisKkeyy: But do you really even need the contact?
[2:04:14] marrinho24: Robery contracts ?
[2:04:28] Kdkuiper: that’s also just for weed, I’m sure robbery will need bitcoin too
[2:04:34] RisKkeyy: I feel like it's a waste of butc
[2:04:37] ItsEdBoi_: depends how bad the 1st guy price is compared to the others
[2:04:38] deivdeivdeiv: the contacts are for people that dont want to corner i guess?
[2:04:44] CommanderKilroy: I think thats just like them calling the cops right?
[2:04:48] CommanderKilroy: No idea tbh
[2:04:56] MONSTERSbruh: Robbery I'm guessing is getting shot by the local buyer. And snitching similar
[2:05:02] apaceboldface: timmac maybe upgrade the gpu in the computer desk than start building the other rack with normal gpu
[2:05:07] DESHAWNTE: @deivdeivdeiv maybe
[2:05:10] WhoKnowz21: I don't see you being able to do all contacts at once.

[2:05:17] Adams2303: ye the contacts don't make sense, why does the contact with most risk require more BTC? @Timmac
[2:05:21] DESHAWNTE: @apaceboldface <3
[2:05:21] ItsEdBoi_: I was thinking bringing the cops down to the block
[2:05:25] appleceee: i think robbery contracts is robbing other peoples hired locals
[2:05:26] CommanderKilroy: So these contracts are for weed, then, right?
[2:05:37] ItsEdBoi_: @Adams2303 Better price
[2:05:39] el_buitre666: cristianaJam2 cristianaJam2 cristianaJam2 cristianaJam2 cristianaJam2
[2:05:40] AnnoyinMercenary: @Timmac but it lists chance of robbery and chance of snitchingn separately
[2:05:41] sickbound: i think maybe 1-2 more basic GPU racks then start to pump the new improved GPU over time?
[2:05:45] RisKkeyy: I think it's the people buying from the contact. They are either more likely to rob your contact or snitch on him
[2:05:59] Gangstajoka: You can't remove the contacts?
[2:06:08] modals0l: would the higher difficulty wifi, have better security?
[2:06:09] CommanderKilroy: ^ thats how i interpret it as well
[2:06:22] MONSTERSbruh: I think the contacts are like the guy under the bridge, but just for your turf
[2:06:25] ItsEdBoi_: think 2nd guy is a trap, 1st or 3rd guy is best
[2:06:54] WhoKnowz21: its probably like prodigy snitch
[2:06:59] Skrimzee__: what other strands are there?
[2:07:06] ItsEdBoi_: Yea might snitch like where your contacts are or something
[2:07:10] marrinho24: I think snitching will be cops Robbery will be contracts
[2:07:24] apaceboldface: curious if K gonna want stay in current turf or move to the ballers
[2:07:38] malanQ: need dried newer tho everyone is out LUL
[2:07:38] RisKkeyy: Well when you sell to locals they can shoot you or call the cops
[2:07:41] CommanderKilroy: I thought maybe it influenced the locals behavior that you were selling the weed to.
[2:07:57] RisKkeyy: I'm thinking it's the same in a sense but the reverse
[2:07:59] deivdeivdeiv: let others experiment, save the coin
[2:08:28] CommanderKilroy: I agree, and do the low cost one to figure it out first
[2:08:30] WhoKnowz21: ok here is another thought what if the contract snitches on people selling in your turf.
[2:08:35] irishmf_24: Least there's some saam gaas weed to sell on the turf and see what happens now
[2:08:38] RisKkeyy: Yeah or just wait and listen to the streets
[2:08:54] apaceboldface: Is Gomer gonna be Seller or planter?
[2:08:58] Skrimzee__: going to need more washing machines getting into this business haha
[2:09:28] sickbound: dont even have a master seller atm though with no bobby
[2:09:34] malanQ: you can just rob locals tho without contracts
[2:09:37] sym_biotic: theres a limit to the amount you can have tho @Skrimzee__
[2:09:38] deivdeivdeiv: did bobby leave for school, peanut might be the only seller available
[2:09:38] marrinho24: Do you reckon their are no robbery contracts as their is no one snitching
[2:09:40] apaceboldface: Gomer might gotta be seller so you can control these times.
[2:09:44] Kdkuiper: true, can you have more than 4 washers now?

[2:10:25] Skrimzee__: i think you can stack the small ones

[3:01:49] sickbound: yeah
[3:02:04] sickbound: those zones really need re-doing at some point
[3:02:04] halos420: IS THAT DRY WEED I SEE?
[3:02:19] papafrank97: cooLUL cooLUL cooLUL
[3:02:22] Adams2303: yeah 1 doesnt have much things to load so i doubt it will make people freeze @Timmac
[3:02:24] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: yeah, it's the good shit
[3:02:27] darkdemonwiz: its when you  are going from the basement to the 2nd floor, depending on where you stand up you enter the entrance room
[3:02:44] killogic916: Talk to Chodie when he gets on about it i think
[3:02:46] appleceee: @Timmac Chodies apartment had DE-humidifiers instead of humidifiers, maybe try that?
[3:02:53] Steelhuf: @Timmac you should restart just one rack and see
[3:02:54] killogic916: @appleceee that meta,
[3:03:10] sickbound: its because it ideally wants walls/doors to load new areas
[3:03:53] sickbound: you leave one area into the other. doesnt matter if it disappears then
[3:04:09] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: lol, toss the body in there
[3:04:24] Adams2303: deer heads in bush
[3:04:36] appleceee: @killogic916 i mean it makes more sense to have dehumidify the weed instead of humidifying it, just common sense rly
[3:04:59] ndx07: uh
[3:05:15] killogic916: @appleceee It actu ally isnt because when you dry weed you dont want it at 0% humidity or that would make the weed crispy/crunchy as fuck

[3:05:29] walnutszs: when you dry weed you use a humidifier, trust me
[3:05:42] appleceee: alright then i admit im wrong my bad
[3:05:54] defy07: Problem is the panel isn't a percentage.
[3:05:58] walnutszs: You dont want to dry it with no humidity in the air all the weed turns to saw dust
[3:06:00] fumaczi: is like oven if you blast full heat and put meat in it will burn on outside but be wet and blody inside
[3:06:13] boss_waka: the problem with that tiom is weed is 100% humidity when its fresh basically so your not letting any of it dry really, you need some humidity but not so much
[3:06:16] Adams2303: timmac weed grower IRL? KEKW
[3:06:18] walnutszs: depends on the strand but usually between 40 and 60 percent
[3:06:20] halos420: @walnutszs well not neccesarily. some people might need a dehumidifier depending on climates
[3:06:28] el_buitre666: its 60% ;)
[3:06:32] boss_waka: LOL
[3:07:03] walnutszs: yea if youre drying indoor you need a humidifier, if your drying in like a barn id imagine the other way around but only dried inside before
[3:07:14] appleceee: although its like that in real life, maybe its not like that in game, cause the people i have seen drying use de-humidifiers
[3:07:26] el_buitre666: yeah...max 60%
[3:07:30] emrejonson: ask 4head, they might bbe struggling with it too
[3:07:42] walnutszs: usually sativas need a bit more humidity to dry well
[3:07:45] Skrimzee__: actually if you times the humidity by the rotation of the earth it's like 51.2%
[3:07:58] trader455: thats cleannn
[3:09:00] boss_waka: thats thw whole reson you started that didnt you lol

[3:24:33] mr_punx_204: Yeah that Big Gap by those stair have looked weird since Mr.K Deleted it and never put it back after he caught the house on fire

[3:25:57] mr_punx_204: The house could be soooo much better obviously that garden room is just weird  if there was Doors going to basement it be smart since if someone broke in they would have to Lock pick each door

[4:49:12] mizzpunx: @ord1125 yessss! this was my idea too
[4:49:15] Adams2303: @Ord1125 3 is better and doable, its just that this was their first house and it was a learning experience for everyone involved
[4:49:23] Quailman1234: sorry for asking again, but how much do you guys owe the investors this week?

[6:46:53] reakwon_: @outsideinsiders yeah the second she said that i was like OOP
[6:46:59] zypher01: They just dont want to lose the taxes
[6:47:00] getyourownjeeves: they have the old book for investment proprietys not the reit info and it caused a lot of confusion
[6:47:04] Dillz213: Waaaaiit a minute!! is this a casting couch? haha LUL LUL
[6:47:07] jeaann2017: @reakwon_ well unfortunately she was one of the voting council members
[6:47:14] killogic916: The REIT is to avoid taxes, the board has little to no reason to have there not be tax on them. That just lost money in their eyes
[6:47:15] zypher01: They want ALL that tax money
[6:47:21] modals0l: they want to catch you guys slip probably
[6:47:22] CazzaDee: Who done up the house

[6:47:36] Kdkuiper: @torrok neither do K or ramee but they were being made examples of bc of their past haha 😂
[6:47:43] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: @CazzaDee gomer
[6:47:46] killogic916: The issue is its losing money for the city by avoiding taxes
[6:47:49] Gashlex: one of the issues is the "state" doesn't want to lose money
[6:47:50] typarks_: well, I got fucked up because they were reading the rental contract, but thought it was about the renter owns. So they were trying to say that it was shady. They just didn't know what they were talking about.
[6:47:58] nova_rubio: LUL
[6:48:00] sturg2k5: it’s because they was going on about rent to own but the contract he seen was one of the rentals so none of it made sense
[6:48:13] jeaann2017: they just see it as the state losing tax money. needs to be proposed that it helps create rental market
[6:48:23] zypher01: how does 16% make sense? most states have 0 tax on property and the highest is like 1.5% irl
[6:48:30] killogic916: None of this was mentioned in the REIT act. Just thats its a tax evasion thing
[6:48:32] shred403: people wont live in 5x5 government boxes
[6:48:42] outsideinsiders: you need to rebrand their bullshit preconceived “K wants to be a slumlord” mentality
[6:48:44] appleceee: they were also afraid of how yall would tax stuff
[6:48:48] jonny282: @zypher01 because its not irl
[6:49:10] zypher01: @jonny282 why would it make sense for a 16% tax rate?
[6:49:36] zypher01: Providing affordable housing is a service to the community and city
[6:49:50] sturg2k5: max didn’t know anything about it really either so he was poor at putting it across properly

[6:50:07] aston_ca: People have hidden rooms,imagine the vinewood ones...people gonna make a maze
[6:50:16] fehn3: it would make sense to base it off irl so then you dont have to make up rules and shit
[6:50:23] reakwon_: yeah the standard talking points for anything to be tax exempt, creates economic growth in the area, you could even tie in that the company is focusing on the low income south side
[6:50:39] halos420: technically it would be, between you, mrk and ott plus investors
[6:50:40] zypher01: @reakwon_ fr
[6:50:40] jeaann2017: OTT needs to pitch it. dab was almost clueless
[6:50:42] killogic916: The proposal was sold HORRIBLY to the council.

[6:51:47] halos420: tbh not all of this is transferable to nopixel its more the premise then anything
[6:51:59] earlbots: I think also pointing out the limitations of appartments and the restriction of house pricing your the only real alternative for those who require it for their businesses
[6:52:15] jeaann2017: they just see it as the state losing tax money
[6:52:20] killogic916: yep
[6:52:25] halos420: even 50% property tax would help alot
[6:52:43] killogic916: @Timmac that was not sold to them
[6:53:00] killogic916: i dont think the labor increrase was ever mentioned
[6:53:05] shred403: also keeps people busy in the server
[6:53:06] outsideinsiders: @earlbots yeah, the doctor lady board member made a comment about the “ridiculous rent costs”… as if every renter wasn’t thrilled about being able to use bigger benches, etc
[6:53:09] sturg2k5: they didn’t know how working out mr k income tax out could be down

[6:53:31] killogic916: u dont, it was denied lol
[6:53:35] jeaann2017: probably never
[6:53:47] Cplkoolaid: they said next meeting
[6:53:49] reakwon_: also to the individuals renting they are presented with more opportunities, thus creating more taxable transactions
[6:53:53] outsideinsiders: Dab being clueless didn’t help, for sure LUL
[6:53:53] sturg2k5: it wasn’t denied
[6:53:57] Gashlex: max just was not prepared, they have plans for an interview
[6:53:58] halos420: i think crane would be the first person to run this through
[6:54:08] nck_at_nite: shiobhan presented it maybe? btu she told k that most of the people were dumb
[6:54:14] earlbots: smaller mechanics etc can’t afford the 200k for a house but need the big benches
[6:54:14] Bmac1825: they said at the next council meeting they will have you guys come in and explain it in more detail, which is Saturday
[6:54:20] sturg2k5: they didn’t vote because they wanted to speak with mr k and his lawyer
[6:54:30] C_G1: that is not getting passed with the ops on that council lol
[6:54:31] typarks_: I think it would be a good idea to talk to crane. He seem like he was the one with the most apprehension.
[6:54:36] halos420: he will make it if he needs to
[6:54:37] irishmf_24: He'll have to be around
[6:54:38] BillsMafiaSTF: It was never put up for vote cuz Dab was in over his head explaining it and withdrew
[6:54:38] getyourownjeeves: it wasnt denied max never brought it to a vote however it opened a can of worms
[6:54:42] killogic916: @sturg2k5 ok it wasn't denied. it turned into a 'lets investigate this company'
[6:54:44] zypher01: Almost no one knows how to do their job on the council
[6:54:48] djhyzel78: I think ott and u being there would be the best
[6:54:50] Roc525: K might switch his sat and sun off
[6:54:51] nck_at_nite: siobhan gets it so she can back you up as y'alls lawyer too
[6:54:52] BiGGHydro: He was off 2 days in a row.. he might
[6:54:52] jasonquinn2022: I’m sorry but the panel seems to be scared of crane and if crane says something no one will say anything against him
[6:54:57] appleceee: they wanted K, you, OTT and siobhan to come to the next council meeting to clarify all this
[6:55:00] Mwm1989: put a TikTok video in discord for ya @timmac
[6:55:17] outsideinsiders: the real estate, HOA, renters situation is genuinely a creative idea that breeds unlimited RP… hard to imagine they shut it down
[6:55:21] Mwm1989: yeah
[6:55:43] NoahS116: have the initial investors on the first and second house been getting their weekly payments yet?
[6:55:47] sturg2k5: the doctors husband his invested into the 2nd rental and she seen it as a scam because he had not seen any payments yet she said that nobody had received any payments
[6:55:51] typarks_: or you could go the more creative route, and Jess kidnap some of the board members and make them see your way lol
[6:55:56] appleceee: @outsideinsiders feels like they dont care about RP opportunities
[6:56:00] getyourownjeeves: also crane an max wanted a meeting set up for today but i maybe wrong id check with max

[6:56:38] TMakBC: REIT got shut down by the council might not want to spend too much time worrying about it
[6:56:41] earlbots: it’s kind of weird they sold it as you having a monopoly on real estate, when you only own % of each property
[6:56:58] sturg2k5: etta I think the doctors called
[6:57:25] Gashlex: @TMakBC shutdown is the wrong word. it got tabled for later discussion
[6:57:53] reakwon_: @earlbots also if they passed the law nothing would stop any other group from making a reit
[6:58:09] skaiixd: not to mention the profits are... well...
[6:58:15] WallyWeaver: It's a great idea
[6:58:22] Texanson: Ah yes the first ones in the market have a "monopoly"
[6:58:26] skaiixd: StonksDown
[6:58:28] appleceee: they also had an example of the OLD rental agreements and not the new REIT one
[6:58:29] earlbots: I think they thought your buying the whole property and renting it out
[6:58:33] jeaann2017: true lol
[6:58:40] emrejonson: as soon as it was presented, they thought one of the council members was an inside man, then said something about 5 property per person/company
[6:58:44] TMakBC: The real state discussion got tabled they said the REIT would not work because it used legislation from outside the city
[6:58:45] hunter14119: It's not a monopoly at the end of the day the customer will be the one that has to pay the taxes. Implementing 1031 is a good way to get people to upgrade their houses so smaller people can come in and buy the cheaper ones
[6:58:45] StreamElements: The thing is, you're like a brother to me, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, business is business, and not for nothing, it is what it is and that's that.
[6:58:48] Bmex11: People don't want to put the work for something that might not pay out
[6:58:51] defy07: K paid out to the investors of the pd house
[6:58:53] sturg2k5: crane was going mental and wanted to end the entire meeting to speak to mr k and his lawyer and find out why he even knew anything about it said it was illegal to lobby which makes no sense
[6:59:04] WallyWeaver: His making good RP ?? Why people hate that
[6:59:05] halos420: i think the craziest thing is people would make more money running gruppe 6 if they spent the same amount of time K has on this realestate business
[6:59:11] harp3r861: If they are worried about the taxes they will find a way round it like taxing business accounts
[6:59:23] reakwon_: yeah i think this is a classic case of people thinking something is shady but not sitting down and asking questions, but just assuming
[6:59:32] mskazzeboy: k live
[6:59:40] jeaann2017: one member even claimed an investors haven't been paid out
[6:59:42] TMakBC: Some ppl on the council were being weird about Mr K running the city from this
[6:59:45] Gashlex: chair time?
[6:59:47] emrejonson: there are no laws for landlord/tennats in the city yet, that was another issue
[6:59:48] outsideinsiders: illegal to speak to your elected representatives… SeemsGood
[6:59:58] sturg2k5: ye how is anything going to get voted on if you can’t lobby
[7:00:01] OhhhFee: sounds like politics
[7:00:03] OhhhFee: yup
[7:00:13] MrCythe: instantly thought k was a scammer. ramee got brought up because of K and they were like. oh he was a terrorist before
[7:00:15] halos420: oop mr k live get in position Gomer
[7:00:26] hypernover: k is waking up
[7:00:32] OhhhFee: now we have a few people who push their personal interest while pretending its for the people
[7:00:33] nerf406: kebunWTF
[7:00:40] halos420: get gomer into position on the couch KEKW
[7:00:40] outsideinsiders: assume the position ! LUL
[7:00:44] zypher01: SHould sit on the couch again LUL
[7:00:58] TMakBC: they trying to max the amount of propertys an entity can own to stop Section K
[7:01:04] typarks_: yeah, it just sounded like they were judging everything from the past.  Dab even said we need new laws so the same things don't happen again.
[7:01:18] sturg2k5: sit down lol
[7:01:20] zypher01: @TMakBC lame af

[7:03:01] halos420: @zypher01 yeah i think it would be a shame if they shut it down since he did all this with zero mechanics added or needed
[7:03:01] zypher01: Quick to the couch!
[7:03:09] BloodHog: what i understood that happened was K talking to a board member about sómething hadnt been passed yet which then spooked the board.
[7:03:21] Gashlex: "welcome to the basement"
[7:03:29] jeaann2017: @BloodHog yeah that was unlucky
[7:03:33] zypher01: @halos420 and all the stuff hes navigated through already like taxes suddenly appearing and lobbying DAB
