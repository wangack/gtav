[3:02:25] xdSilly: o7
[3:02:50] BakinPacman: they basically would need a driver to support them
[3:03:02] lucho724_: as annoying as that barrier to weed is, i think its sooooo smart by the devs
[3:03:06] lucho724_: you can't just walk into the drug game
[3:03:50] lucho724_: its a crim barrier
[3:03:55] SlyDolphin: and its still not a whitelist which is good
[3:03:59] r3_clay: im wondering if weed is a gateway drug, or if all drugs will  be seperate
[3:04:01] lucho724_: cause in 3.0 you could just buy weed, do a run and make 30-50k
[3:04:01] SuperTrooperJoe: the devs honestly did such a good job with everything with 4.0
[3:04:06] Lozza_95: DinoDanse
[3:04:13] BakinPacman: they would sling meth day 1
[3:04:23] lucho724_: arnie made 2.5 mil in a month via weed runs.
[3:04:26] lucho724_: that's wild
[3:04:32] kiri_nz: Yea you actually have to commit to make any sort of profit
[3:05:01] turntablist_mk2: it's gonna get crazy when u make your own recipes in the end
[3:05:02] FLv_Smoke: You actually can't be solo
[3:05:08] r3_clay: what has arnie been upto? bit burned out of rp?
[3:05:09] lucho724_: but even then, mario could come around do 2 weed runs and have money again
[3:05:27] Psyc83: The whole progression system that 4.0 brought is genius with everything having an effect in other areas
[3:05:27] lucho724_: i love the fact that it seems you have to build an organization and ppl have to have jobs
[3:05:37] BakinPacman: grimers holding weapons is funny LUL
[3:05:40] KyleGLFC: they were sus of you
[3:05:42] chloe_shadow: Lozza flowerr
[3:05:49] MrKing8: YEP
[3:05:56] Lozza_95: Chloe flowerr
[3:05:58] lucho724_: solo is horrible
[3:06:01] HEGGA: That just promotes RP though, shouldn't be solo all the time
[3:06:03] beckylouise__: Yep solo dolo is not good
[3:06:03] littlesez: l miss arnie and ace jjfrieLove arnieLove
[3:06:06] BakinPacman: its because they want people to talk to each other
[3:06:09] lucho724_: but in RP that kinda makes sense
[3:06:13] lucho724_: you shouldn't be alone
[3:06:27] BakinPacman: yeah that is also true
[3:06:29] r3_clay: at least the hq app isn't gang related/white listed anymore tho
[3:06:29] brewticus: gang has to be huge to cover all your bases too

[3:08:59] Jay_rb: KEKW

[3:11:41] ProPlayerPANiK: So wat new gangs r there
[3:12:42] r3_clay: the polish guys are pretty new
[3:14:10] ProPlayerPANiK: Hmmm
[3:14:28] loveloopx: thats slys gang
[3:14:31] lucho724_: new gangs are a few of the MCs, the company, and the polish crew
[3:14:34] iraffis: So wait is sessie and oakley doing a weed run
[3:14:38] lucho724_: Kaneshiro is basically Yokai
[3:14:53] optikz1: ya
[3:14:58] BVNISH: no
[3:14:59] BakinPacman: yes and no
[3:15:01] BVNISH: not even close
[3:15:06] lucho724_: its a mix of Yokai and Simone's group
[3:15:09] sne26_: Yokai with new members but not focused on racing
[3:15:09] ul_1998: Not all of them
[3:15:12] Kwni: most of em ex ykai or already working with yokai
[3:15:16] kiri_nz: The core were
[3:15:17] BVNISH: they're all Yokai is the ignorant take

[3:15:46] iraffis: Yea but they on a different mind set do
[3:15:48] puhctek: i mean her idea of making it was to have yokai but not be a racing crew only?
[3:16:00] puhctek: so it's effectively yokai at the end of the day
[3:16:17] r3_clay: is the guild still the old guild?
[3:16:18] lucho724_: Mary, Violet, May, Patrick, Michael, Yuki, Kass, JJ, and a few more were Yokai, they have new faces just like anyone
[3:16:22] FLv_Smoke: With the amount of different branches you need to have a functioning system you might elevate to something more than a gang
[3:16:27] lucho724_: its a more serious version of the old crew
[3:16:31] puhctek: yea
[3:16:49] souceboi: Mary gangsta cuh

[3:22:57] BVNISH: @lucho724_ Michael isn't in KC. Yuki wasn't in Yokai I don't think. Jazz being top 3 most influential people changes so much. And in the member/hangy level it's completely different people

[3:35:22] TekEvolution: This house will be a real trap house once you guys move to MP
[3:35:22] lucho724_: then you can turn this into like weed house
[3:35:36] kiri_nz: And this setup will be cool to look at when selling too

[3:37:00] Krookd1: Could try a chopie chop at night and see if it tanks it

[3:37:20] lucho724_: that makes sense
[3:37:24] HEGGA: Yeah makes sense
[3:37:25] TheWooD115: Probably So

[3:38:42] Krookd1: If you have to have specific ppl for every single job contact thats gonna be a little silly

[3:41:57] Krookd1: Imagine if it is car dmg
[3:42:01] xkayb_: it could make sense that its group 6 since its dirty money vs clean money
[3:42:02] TheWooD115: How much rep did u loose ??
[3:42:08] Krookd1: Every car you bring back is fucjed
[3:42:22] Krookd1: I mean hell 1 came back on a tow truck that 1 day lolol
[3:42:36] iraffis: I mean you can test it
[3:42:47] HEGGA: There was 1 time you couldn't turn in the car for scuff no? Did you check if you lost rep cause of that?
[3:42:48] lucho724_: g6 would make no sense
[3:42:52] Kdkuiper: It may have just updated now that pawn runs in, they might be connected with grime then
[3:42:54] manny_281: it might be condition of the car
[3:42:55] XxGazzaGazxX: maybe doing the ATM on g6
[3:42:57] SuperTrooperJoe: maybe it’s scuffed?
[3:42:57] iraffis: One run with a perfect car
[3:43:00] lucho724_: clean job vs dirty job
[3:43:05] iraffis: Seconden run smash it up
[3:43:13] TenkSyncri: couldn't it not be the one that was bugged when you went to marry meeting
[3:43:15] lucho724_: i'm thinking maybe you have to do either or for VU
[3:43:17] lucho724_: can't do both
[3:43:21] Krookd1: Stuff changes every storm so it could be anything tbh
[3:43:24] TheWooD115: Maybe just not doing it for a couple of days , I can see that ??
[3:43:28] lucho724_: check your VU rep maybe?
[3:43:37] pixalie: it could be rep reset, who knows
[3:43:48] ramsybottyhol: u had the run where u had to tow the car and it scuffed could be that
[3:43:54] lucho724_: oh trueeee
[3:43:56] Kdkuiper: could be G6 vs money runs / Grime vs Jewelry runs
[3:43:58] necromitzeta: Hi sileent
[3:44:09] lucho724_: there was that one job you didn't return the car
[3:44:12] lucho724_: cause of the tow
[3:44:13] adamantiuum: Maybe she doesn’t turn in broken cars
[3:44:33] XxGazzaGazxX: maybe ATM v cleaning
[3:44:36] ALK1RO: g6 effecting money runs kinda make sense
[3:44:47] lucho724_: maybe that dink'd you
[3:44:52] lucho724_: and i think that was the last run you did
[3:45:01] XxGazzaGazxX: or yes could be not returning car
[3:45:06] SchnitzleKing: and after not returning you didnt do another run, so it could be that
