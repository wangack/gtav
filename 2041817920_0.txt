[1:11:31] 420thMagicMan: this whole atm drama seems like a really cheap red flag about Mary. if it wasn’t this situation then it probably would be a more expensive and bloodier conflict later

[1:36:36] ScarletThePaladin: I mean I can see both sides you are a smart person at least in my view but also you do have a goofy side
[1:36:38] Madam_Orange: NODDERS l takes isnt exclusive to one house
[1:36:39] Tyler4AM: I'm a gryffindor, we don't believe in L takes
[1:36:44] Tyler4AM: We're on the sigma male grindset
[1:36:50] Voltorin: the real question is what is your patronus? uhnPeep
[1:36:52] Madam_Orange: ew
[1:37:06] ItsJardo: its my headcanon that the character on Legacy is meant to be a Ravenclaw
[1:37:09] Tyler4AM: You're so edgy omg

[1:37:44] Bronzejackk: hufflepuff has best common room
[1:37:51] wizardiis: KEKW
[1:37:56] Tyler4AM: I used to be ravenclaw but when I took the test before you played the game I switched to Gryffindor
[1:37:58] opalducky: We are just nice people bro kivaSuffer
[1:37:58] Kylur: HUFFLEPUFF IS BEST HOUSEEEEE kivaRage

[1:46:14] CautiousDani: wow cedrics dad my boy syndrome much 🤭
[1:46:20] ItsJardo: im just saying Dudley in the books way better than Dudley in the movies
[1:46:38] Tyler4AM: I am not a Dursley sympathizer ok
[1:46:53] madizombie: Doesn't Dudley stand up to his dad for Harry at the end or something?
[1:47:24] AdamElJefe: I love this playlist
[1:47:39] opalducky: Yeah but a horrible person doing one good thing in the end doesn't make me like them enough kivaLUL
[1:47:40] ItsJardo: after the dementor attack his character starts to get redeeming qualities
[1:48:01] madizombie: oh waow the bare minimum kivaLUL
[1:48:11] darkestnight333: Maggie Smith was to Mcgonagall, as in Rdj is to Iron Man, or Hugh Jackman to Wolverine
[1:48:12] Tyler4AM: There's also a deleted scene of Draco helping out Harry instead of just walking away with his parents, but they cut it kivaDesk
[1:48:13] DJ_4point0: "You know? Maybe your not so much of a waste of space."
[1:48:29] Buzzabeel: close enough

[1:48:58] Anrisacia: KEKW
[1:49:02] madizombie: KEKW
[1:49:03] CSKo_5: my favourite fan lore is that Dudley has a kid or two that ends up being magic and going to Hogwarts

[1:49:13] darkestnight333: ^
[1:49:24] darkestnight333: @CSKo_5 argreed
[1:49:39] Anrisacia: Yo unicorn! kivaPog
[1:49:44] Thrath: Oh no its a unicorn
[1:50:06] CSKo_5: omg the lore thing from Reddit is so wholesome
[1:50:09] Thrath: Yeah at least the rep gain chalupaNODDERS
[1:50:30] Tyler4AM: Dudley's son Duncan Dursley, the greatest wizard who ever leived
[1:50:33] Tyler4AM: *lived
[1:50:33] CSKo_5: like Dudley’s kid is in hufflepuff and he has no idea what that is but yeah super proud
[1:50:44] DJ_4point0: Dudley running to Harry holding his kid out like "help this"
[1:50:51] ItsJardo: i have such high hopes for the HBO series
[1:51:12] madizombie: the thought that counts NODDERS
[1:51:21] CSKo_5: also the way Dudley stepped over the chain link fence while staring at Vernon is comedic as fuuck
[1:51:30] opalducky: It's a step in the right direction NODDERS
[1:51:48] Buzzabeel: what would the response be? “t-thanks?”
[1:51:51] Anrisacia: kivaAH It's the tree police!
[1:51:53] MYounk: I want a Guiseppe Stromboli version
[1:52:00] CSKo_5: @buzzabeel literally yes
[1:52:21] Kylur: Who's everyones favorite mom figure in the series? Narcissa, Molly, McGonagall, etc.?
[1:52:30] opalducky: The children of everyone from the war maybe?
[1:52:34] MYounk: like he's a kid who wants to be a chef, but is magic, so he's learning all this magic but he just wants to be a chef
[1:52:43] Tyler4AM: I want them to do a spinoff of something super random, like Moaning Myrtle
[1:52:48] CSKo_5: @kylur Andromeda Tonks
[1:53:02] DJ_4point0: I haven't read any, and it's probably not gonna happen, but some of the super high quality fan fiction getting done would probably have the best stories.
[1:53:17] CSKo_5: a series of just one shot episodes that focus on outlier characters
[1:53:36] ItsJardo: i still wish they’d make a wizarding world show where its just stories of things in lore like nearly headless nicks story before his execution
[1:53:40] Tyler4AM: Or a Sirius Black series
[1:53:46] MYounk: Guiseppe Stromboli and the Pancetta of Azkaban
[1:53:47] CSKo_5: @itsjardo omg yes
[1:53:54] opalducky: They could even make their own character and set it in universe
[1:54:39] CSKo_5: Like “The real story of Merlin” and it’s a regular wizard that happens to befriend a king and doesn’t tell him about the ENTIRE WIZARDING WORLD LIKE WTF
[1:54:41] Anrisacia: Sadge
[1:54:58] Madam_Orange: or like the founding of the school, that would be pretty sick
[1:55:19] Tyler4AM: My favorite HP mom is Hagrid
[1:55:29] Kylur: Narcissa is my fav character in the whole series, She reminds me so much of my mom.
[1:55:41] MYounk: what about Tonks
[1:56:00] CSKo_5: @madam_orange that would be really good too because contextually it would help make sense historically as to why Salazar only wanted purebloods
