[0:07:51] EnochBlanche: You missed a lot yesterday
[0:07:56] Lord_Machiavellian: Ssaab do you feel that the LSPD are a little too limited in what they can do to stop fleeing criminals?   I watched a heist yesterday (Won't go into details if you don't want to know), but it seemed ridiculous.
[0:08:10] m1tchole: Hope you're feeling better Ssaab

[0:09:37] EnochBlanche: There's a difference between a challenge, and straight ridiculous though?
[0:09:41] dakota22446: PotFriend
[0:09:42] laniatx09: I like the gradual growth of the pd
[0:09:44] The_Arrival_: Would adding a fire department be good for rp?
[0:09:45] heat31: Is Leo breaking down cars?
[0:09:56] Lord_Machiavellian: Well, they literally had the car pinned and surrounded and people got away because they had a limited ability to respond once they pinned them
[0:10:03] laniatx09: A slow build up  is always wanted
[0:10:08] Aptii_: i wanna see the cops just fucking shoot every criminal when they break the law
[0:10:10] whteversara: heyyy twinkl49Wave
[0:10:22] RandomShungiteCD: @Aptii_ OMEGALUL
[0:10:32] Spired12: I mean, the crims still complain the PD is too stong still
[0:10:36] BigAmpTrice: Not many criminals have got guns
[0:10:38] Wave_TF: But roleplay is cringe Kappa
[0:10:39] ForgottenJones: yooooooooo
[0:10:41] Lepaca: kinamaWave
[0:10:48] EnochBlanche: so personally i feel like being tased is useless. Watched someone get tased 3 times, just got up and kept running and resisting cuffs repeatedly
[0:10:49] fulladelphia: fred from scooby doo outfit
[0:10:50] SumDee_LumDee: there just needs to be more cops around by the time shift 3 rolls around to be honest, that and the paperwork can be tedious and time consuming at times
[0:10:51] Aptii_: pvp raids seem so much better than pve imo W L
[0:11:22] jd2881: That box yesterday was so infuriating. They just had to sit there and watch the crims call for their swap.
[0:11:25] uni1144: interaction rather than competition
[0:11:26] BigAmpTrice: DNA is going to big
[0:11:37] Lord_Machiavellian: That does. I think that is a great take. I just think it was silly that they had the car surrounded and the criminals were able to get out of it because of mechanics and restraints
[0:11:37] reydedark: saabHalt walk there
[0:11:40] KjetilHestvik: trainboss time
[0:11:40] laniatx09: Yes a train ride!
[0:11:44] SumDee_LumDee: I think half of the PD last night were at MRPD doing paper work while there was a hostage situation at the docks

[0:12:13] sneaky_snake__: PD should get equipment to brake windows after boxing someone
[0:12:17] sneaky_snake__: break
[0:12:21] m1tchole: I only just realised this is Snake Eater playing
[0:12:29] laniatx09: saabAw
[0:12:29] my69thaccount: cop rp has become paperwork rp. it has become so boring
[0:12:31] Aptii_: @ricantvee who interviewed you saabHappy

[0:12:41] Asmodean01: Is this a Sax version of Snake eater...?

[0:12:45] Eddie1225: @my69thaccount what OMEGALAUGHING
[0:12:49] Eddie1225: cop rp has always been the same
[0:12:50] Eddie1225: so
[0:12:54] Eddie1225: idk what your on
[0:12:54] ricantvee: @Aptii_ page
[0:12:56] Rockshock: Think the biggest issue cuffs seems almost harmless cause everyone resists out of them three times or more in a row.
[0:12:59] Eddie1225: yep
[0:13:02] heat31: Not flawless, but it needs to at least be competitive. Some aspects there's a massive crim gap.
[0:13:02] scaredsquid: also if they caught every criminal while they’re building their criminal empire that wouldn’t really be fun for anyone
[0:13:06] fulladelphia: pd could hire 200+ cops so theres no room for crims on the server.
[0:13:06] ForgottenJones: NODDERS
[0:13:16] psylongti: The craziest thing is how many PITS a rental car can take
[0:13:16] mannerrrrrr: it's almost like the whole city collapsed

[0:13:35] Illuminati_pro: Aren't criminals already doing this?
[0:13:35] Thunis: chatters just needs to respect the roleplay
[0:13:40] eff_han: a well reasoned take, i respect it
[0:13:43] Aptii_: cops should just get flusha and kennys to rp and then we'll see some real rp
[0:13:44] Lord_Machiavellian: That's a great take
[0:13:50] rclemon_: ssaabExplainingWhy
[0:13:52] RandomShungiteCD: save it for the podcast KEKW
[0:13:54] SumDee_LumDee: I think the problem is that PD still feels like it’s on day one while the crims all feel like they’re months ahead, sometimes feels unbalanced is all
[0:13:56] Tigriopus: Does PD ever gain other Less lethal options? Like bean bag guns? (new to rp)
[0:14:01] duffrose1980: chat is overly dramatic. At all times
[0:14:01] Illuminati_pro: They are just limited because of the amount of guns
[0:14:02] laniatx09: When's the next podcast

[0:14:11] jessv23: saabWave

[0:15:35] EnochBlanche: I get the struggle, and the balance, but i think the problem people are saying is that there isnt a balance. it seems overly heavily skewed towards the crims
[0:15:36] icarusdjr: my life for LSPD
[0:15:39] jd2881: I think once they make a car swap the force against should ramp up. The constant cuff breaking gets old fast.
[0:15:40] mMattyP: o7
[0:15:45] MsFreya_x: @Stackswyd Mods are stinky
[0:15:47] BoldSlowbro: PD needed a captain yesterday
[0:15:51] Eddie1225: get hit by the train and perma
[0:15:52] SumDee_LumDee: I feel like there should be more than one PD open though, being able to work out of multiple locations around the city would make it easier to fight crime however you would need more officers first of course
[0:15:54] Eddie1225: problem solved

[0:35:45] wavep987: @lookingfornothinghere same. Specially with the limited cop numbers, I hope not all robberies are full 6. It gets too much.
[0:36:08] lookingfornothinghere: @Alekdk1 exactly casino level heist = 6 man would be good but imagine gang wars is literally 12 people for every scene
[0:36:51] lookingfornothinghere: cops scale with their response maybe crims should scale with crime level a stolen car shouldnt be 6 criminals
[0:36:52] CuBanMumzy: @quasigeo certain federal and government entities do not care its 2024. You can't have that hair in the military, The ladies should probably have their hair up in the PD

[1:18:47] c0rnishatheart: @talamah slacks made him
[1:19:04] Bob_Sanders: @ilmasonii potentially too much blood rendering on the ground based on another stream I was watching
[1:19:17] ericthebananna: hello ssaab hello chat saabHi
[1:19:31] Lord_Legolas: I thought someone an the PD would have a PCs at this point to keep up with updates, PD is hella behind now

[1:21:14] DawnMarie: do they know how often new shipments of these crates come in yet?
[1:21:16] Rockshock: It's funny cause bones literally has to disadvantage himself with cars to not overpower in chases while these complain about cars.

[1:23:10] YEP46: Clueless
[1:23:12] jennindf: yeah it doesnt make any sense
[1:23:20] marneraiders: Because It probably sound like a Clickbait criminal
[1:23:29] buddha_hands: did any cops try it to verify
[1:23:31] taraannee: why (real)? bc it’s real LUL
[1:23:31] LEONIDAS_3: saabDespair
[1:23:42] knowlightnofear: some of us that were watching yesterday, were pretty confident that they witnessed a crim give a stolen vehicle to a fence...lol and then the NPC that he took them too,  he "couldn't get another car from"... Likely the guy who sends you out to steal a specific car
[1:23:43] Lord_Legolas: make sense if you don't have lockpicks
[1:23:47] knowlightnofear: but they were all confident it was a rental
[1:23:52] taraannee: @buddha_hands 3 aziz, den & corn did
[1:23:57] laniatx09: Dont know about this
[1:23:59] jennindf: 1000 for a test drive?
[1:23:59] ToxiccLadd: wait so its just a 1k getaway rental then no?
[1:24:01] thekaptainzhere: @buddha_hands yes he took them to the guy lol
[1:24:06] masteredgar1000: PD needs a helicopter soon 🚁
[1:24:09] buddha_hands: @taraannee they actually rented one?
[1:24:24] knowlightnofear: @buddha_hands They saw the RETURN, but the guy "couldn't GET a car"
[1:24:30] Hibob222: great evidence
[1:24:31] HogballTV: Johnson was there too @taraannee
[1:24:36] laniatx09: Chop cars plus 1

[1:24:48] Hibob222: NODDERS
[1:24:55] sickboysb: it’s funny when you get people that talk to the cops in the way this guy did.
[1:25:00] sagezz1: set up some bait cars in the future
[1:25:01] marneraiders: @knowlightnofear Even if it wasn’t real, that guy delivered the best Story in a long time
[1:25:03] taraannee: @buddha_hands idk if that’d be like mg info since slacks wasn’t here sooo i don’t wanna risk saying but ill just say they verified it
[1:25:14] lookingfornothinghere: is this an actual thing?
[1:25:25] skitz0o1: @lookingfornothinghere yes
[1:25:25] jennindf: but dont people just steal cars for that
[1:25:29] lookingfornothinghere: its only one witness yet right
[1:25:29] FeelsMelancholyMan: Yep
[1:25:33] BoldSlowbro: Finalluy learned a mechanic before the crims
[1:25:40] Rolymole09: if this is true, its easy cars for jobs for crims
[1:25:46] Sathure: @buddha_hands The local wouldn't talk to them. Likely won't to cops.
[1:25:53] powerhouse2406: barely any criminals know about this, the fact the pd found it before them is crazy
[1:25:53] sickboysb: it’s very much an unverified story
[1:25:54] iJerrBear: so crims get supercars and have access to rob merryweather crates already?
[1:25:59] laniatx09: Who rented it to him
[1:26:03] 9Rux: @rolymole09 what cars?
[1:26:07] Janman88: the video material is pretty solid i think
[1:26:17] leo_bwo: @laniatx09 an npc silly goose

[1:26:31] laniatx09: I'll find out in rp
[1:26:33] nick_dr1ft: rentals have time limits though right?
[1:26:35] lookingfornothinghere: so its the getaway car to get to their 3 personal swap cars Aware
[1:26:55] ToxiccLadd: @lookingfornothinghere Lmao true
[1:27:08] nLIMBO: thats so cap, they got 2 cars from the race last night lol
[1:27:11] eqnjn: Taurus for sure got buffed yesterday, it's super fast now
[1:27:22] ITZxJeff: just put a turbo in it
[1:27:27] lookingfornothinghere: this is inteded to be a car to ditch the problem is crims will see this as 1 free swap without risking a personal car LUL
[1:27:35] Rockshock: Have any of these people seen Bones chase people in them lol?
[1:27:40] Lord_Legolas: Turbo is Taurus will be fire
[1:27:51] nLIMBO: the good pd drivers can keep up just fine, they caught racers last night in supercars lol

[1:33:39] hudzzeyfa: Hello there Captain Leo Slacks, hold this for me...BANG!
[1:33:45] Rockshock: Make the explorer swat vehicles in the future
[1:35:15] sagezz1: don’t we call off all dangerous chases anyway?
[1:35:24] nLIMBO: the car feedback should come from suarez and mcnulty or other top tier drivers. they caught multiple racers last night @Ssaab
[1:35:57] lynnchesque: i think irl cops said the same thing, but their explorers are all wheel drive, and stick to the road so they grew on them
[1:36:09] Bill_Collector: That's just one guy tho
[1:36:12] Wheez_3D: @nLIMBO Instead they have below average drivers testing xD
[1:36:21] Itz_CIose: @nlimbo yea that’s what I was thinking. Is info from “bad” drivers worth it KEKW
[1:36:27] marneraiders: The Cadillac Is supposed to be Highway Interceptor from how it works
[1:36:30] ELEGlGGLE: imagine thinking everyone in pd is godlike drivers AINTNOWAY
[1:36:39] karadar_uk: Tobii's gauntlet on Michael Simone goes 180
[1:36:51] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, King_Rexy! Welcome to the Saabscribers! saabH
[1:36:58] Rockshock: imo. Bones should be the only one giving feedback on cars lol. He outdrives people in the cars these think are shit
[1:37:16] King_Rexy: King_Rexy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! FRICK Ads
[1:37:33] Thraxton1: the reset everyones g6 status I think
[1:37:37] lookingfornothinghere: the explorer does look like the soy version of the tahoe or escalade
[1:37:43] HogballTV: @Rockshock or "brock letty"
[1:37:46] NarwhalArgy: @Rockshock I think the problem is you're trying to argue something that a single person can do vs the whole pd
[1:38:18] jimmyyyg: I think Buddha said people with felonies Can still work these jobs since they’re going easy on people for now but a couple months down the line it’ll be changed
[1:38:18] nLIMBO: the only ppl that should give feedback are Suarez/McNulty/Brock/Bones...
[1:38:26] YEP46: PogO polam
[1:39:00] sendu6666: no evidence no nothing
[1:39:02] BurningFlag: @jimmyyyg yeh that's what he said

[1:39:36] joewelch29: he said he would drop all his friends to be a cop
[1:39:37] nearbymethdealer: The guy that sells grenades out of his house?
[1:39:40] Thraxton1: @nLIMBO that's dumb, most of PD are not that good drivers, the cars should be balanced around that, not the best of the best
[1:39:48] TropicalToucan: Susge Maybe too honest
[1:39:49] taraannee: why are we giving any weight to jp just sayin shit when hes a proven liar LUL LUL

[1:42:14] rstineffect: Pd hiest possibilities

[1:43:39] ELEGlGGLE: SURELY u will get 30 at all times
[1:43:45] whaleownage: yea for pd property is always forward operating base or luxury
[1:43:56] Hello_Kinnie: is there enough cars to do 30 at a time though?>
[1:44:19] Afterman_: couldnt they just increase the number of cars when needed?
[1:44:24] dakota22446: OMEGALAUGHING
[1:44:37] Latertoyl: I just saw you hit 130, thats clearly too OP
[1:44:45] marneraiders: But that’s what the VSTR/Escalade is for
[1:44:47] Cyrical: Your awesome SSAAB
[1:44:52] ELEGlGGLE: can you buy this? wideduckass
[1:44:52] Lord_Legolas: only 4 gears... it should be at least 7, up to 180
[1:44:59] dakota22446: wideduckass
[1:45:02] tsebaka: Gonna be hard to catch up to the cars doing 170-220 right now.
[1:45:02] ITZxJeff: denz was scared to buy one cuz he though you couldnt
[1:45:06] Thraxton1: @Ssaab Something's weird with the Taurus, others have been getting the Taurus to 154 easily before
[1:45:07] pabraic: how many people can be on the server at a time
[1:45:08] marneraiders: The VSTR is the highway rocket going 160+
[1:45:08] buddha_hands: this car is PDs best bet right now for sure lol most chases are in the city, lots of twists/turns with quick acceleration
[1:45:21] buddha_hands: not sure any of the regular patrol cars have the top speed for highway blasters

[1:45:32] GrumpyTreeFrog: @Ssaab what if someone gets fired do they turn thr car back in?
[1:45:48] tsebaka: There is actual four doors doing 200 with 3 people with a turbo!
[1:46:11] Latertoyl: @buddha_hands as soon as crims figure that out everyone will just run to the highway knowing its an easy getaway
[1:46:23] marneraiders: If the Taurus becomes the fastest PD vehicle now, being the best at cornering, best at breaking => you got an “OP” Car. Having dedicated vehicles for certain roles is way better
[1:46:37] buddha_hands: @Latertoyl it already happens OMEGALAUGHING
[1:47:09] Count_Brennuvarg: guzuBeliever chat this drinking game was a bad idea
[1:47:13] c0rnishatheart: people already obsessing over car speeds and balance its going to rock back and forth as usual
[1:47:26] MisterParry: What car was Den Zel using to chase Eugene? That one hit 160+
[1:47:27] marneraiders: But don’t you have the VSTR or Bufallos for the Highways Going 155+
[1:47:40] Thraxton1: @Ssaab Denzel was doing 155 when chasing Eugene yesterday in a Taurus so something might be weird with the cars
[1:47:52] StreamElements: Make sure to check out my Youtube Channel!  saabHype -  https://cutt.ly/SaabYT
[1:47:55] buddha_hands: he mustve had a turbo
[1:48:03] Jaster_Reylu: bottle empty @Count_Brennuvarg ?
[1:48:09] Thraxton1: No there's no turbos in the Taurus's
[1:48:19] jaginterface: O7
[1:48:20] Thraxton1: they literally cant take one
[1:48:22] buddha_hands: strange
[1:48:25] jaginterface: OMEGALUL
[1:48:26] marneraiders: as I said: Caracara: Off-road/Oursuit support. VSTR for the Highways. Taurus for the cities. Explorer allround
[1:48:49] Thraxton1: I mean Cornwood was also noticing something weird when he was testing
[1:48:53] buddha_hands: it's weird cuz chases also tend to mix shit car x insane car x shit car x insane car etc
[1:49:27] c0rnishatheart: also the better drivers in PD will know whats good and what isnt. Others will always complain about speed

[2:52:43] crowgoes: @Nerdversity we all know how this plays out haha
[2:52:48] devintalktech: @Eddie1225, Oo 100% should be frisked, the search of the car is the hard sell due to denzel's poor articulation of the PC. I've seen officers lose cases, and then everything found became fruits of the poisonus tree and the whole case falls apart. Again though this is RP so different burden of proof.

[3:27:40] Switchblade142: @BadRabbits Yeah for real, he might have just misworded/misremembered/seen the situation differently and isn't necessarily lying.
[3:27:45] Clivent: now wolfaGiggle
[3:27:55] Krimson07_: BadRabbits, i was thinking more for slacks and den
[3:28:02] Cyrical: It will go out that he lied and everything pd says will be under a microscop and they will say they all lied.
[3:28:05] eqnjn: This is gonna make some cool RP if Johnson goes with the revenge arc vs PD and/or K
[3:28:12] Purecrew: @AnasKwTii No like Honorable discharge, All the head trauma hes suffered hes losing it.
[3:28:19] Cyrical: did they talk to him about it?
[3:28:20] Wynter282: i dont think punching is bad if hes defending himself lol a punch does less damage than beating them with a stick
[3:28:21] BadRabbits: @Krimson07_ there was no threat made against them though right?
[3:28:54] Cyrical: LOL, he cleared it
[3:28:56] MWRGaming: rollback?
[3:29:01] Silbullet: Same issue we had before probably
[3:29:02] jukla12: could be the rollback thing
[3:29:05] Rare__Potato: MDT proper fucked OMEGALAUGHING
[3:29:09] strawberryraye: fuckkjkk
[3:29:17] Cyrical: cant fire him now, no evidence
[3:29:18] Purecrew: @Ssaab Didnt they question him after he got shot in the head, Could you RP it as foggy memory?
[3:29:21] Jake_RP: @Rare__Potato Not just MDT its the whole server LUL
[3:29:23] urkuri92: @wynter282 the others stories don’t match up for him defending himself though
[3:29:35] Zinnabunz: that means johnsons saved HYPEPOGGERS
[3:29:46] BakinPacman: Why is it rollback when critical cases are happening. Sussy as hell.
[3:29:47] Krimson07_: BadRabbits, they couldve argued that they believe theres a weapon in the car based on the 13a call Hmmm not sure
[3:29:49] ShinJiHun: LUL
[3:29:54] ShinJiHun: classic PD
[3:29:57] spicyville: hasn’t he punched people multiple times?
[3:30:05] justind33: Didnt de rolo write it in the MDT?
[3:30:23] BadRabbits: @Krimson07_ if there was a witnes statement, absolutely. but i don't think the medic's statement was enough
[3:30:33] riftshadow: Johnson should be put on long-term disability for all the head trauma he's experienced in the line of duty.
[3:31:08] ItsMavray: The first cop fired from PD in 4.0 and its not Den?

[3:31:29] ChocolateMassage: Send him to doc
[3:31:35] Switchblade142: Is it possible that he isnt necessarily lying but is just mistaken about what constitutes self defense? Still bad but not as bad as lying
[3:31:47] spicyville: @timedoggg he will get lots more when he joins CG
[3:32:02] Seabearzz: the hard part about being the boss Saddies
[3:32:13] Krimson07_: @Krimson07_ mhm true also would depend if pd is allowed to use borader case laws outside the city cuz im pretty sure there is a case law for that

[3:35:55] AddyAdam: lawyers can piss on their cars while criminals punch them in the face lol
[3:36:05] buddha_hands: ya @Cyrical it's more about lying to superiors, not staying to get the guy medical etc etc

[3:44:35] Mic_Stargazer: Yeah she never ACTUALLY told him to stop, she jsut kept saying "Johnson, Johnson!!! Oh god..." then avoided the fight. I don't think she's lying on her report but she's definitely misremembering the situation. He was never given an order to actually stop...
[3:44:37] BabyJoker: honestly everything he said happened how it did so far.  Seems extreme to fire him instead of guiding him. Him, den and aziz are goated cops on the pd rn

[3:53:45] DocRavage: He didn't lie he just omitted part of it.
[3:53:51] ShinJiHun: !meta
[3:53:51] StreamElements: Please do not meta in chat, which means do not tell Saab stuff happening in RP that his character would otherwise not know.
[3:53:52] joel_alex: I do not read Reddit.
[3:53:55] devintalktech: Why would 2 officers not try and stop it, why would 2 officers not get involved, why would 2 officers not arrest K?
[3:53:56] Zinnabunz: saabHmm
[3:54:05] just_james69: @rclemon_ I'll follow that Reddit thread

[3:54:22] YEP46: Sadge i have seen this plot before
[3:54:32] Switchblade142: @M3disyn They should, but it's not the same as lying to not include them.
[3:54:33] Mic_Stargazer: @Kevz95 I was there during it and rewatched it, he was never asked to stop. The female officer just said his name twice
[3:54:37] smo_ot: oh boy lol

[3:57:11] Switchblade142: I mean he might have just not heard them
[3:57:13] iJerrBear: He omitted facts because he wasnt asked to give explicit details of the situation
[3:57:13] smo_ot: He said he got punched, and replied that he beat his ass
[3:57:17] lilisongss: wjay the vod she never said stop and he said ocean king ect

[3:58:17] big_hern139: @downtowncrownn no, they literally just watch everything go down and stayed silent
[3:58:20] Brewday445: Not once did the other 2 officers say anything they legit let it happen. IMO their at fault along with Johnson
[3:58:22] ShinJiHun: He definitely didn't lie
[3:58:22] buddha_hands: just cant have ya lyin (that includes omitting details) to superiors when asked about situations

[3:59:13] Kevz95: @Krimson07_ if he doesn't fight for his job, he's gone anyways, he might as well plead his case
[3:59:13] CuBanMumzy: @buddha_hands  omitting on purposes? or you just don't recall every detail?

[3:59:24] Wynter282: yea nobody actually told him to stop lol
[3:59:24] xoMRoPINKox: just subscribed to tell you in clip NO ONE SAYS JOHNSON STOP they all just say his name
[3:59:26] Zinnabunz: OMEGALAUGHING wait

[3:59:35] Krimson07_: Kevz95, thats what the review panel is for
[3:59:36] talamah: LookUp
[3:59:39] buddha_hands: @CuBanMumzy well he's been asked about it closer to when it happened too where he def would've remembered lol
[3:59:46] DocRavage: Other 2 officers are lying
[3:59:47] downtowncrownn: chat complaining about officers facing consequences when they wanted it for the longest time KEKW
[4:00:00] Wynter282: johnson 100% did wrong but he didnt lie at all
[4:00:01] Krimson07_: she didnt ask me, not my fault YouGotMe
[4:00:04] Kevz95: @Krimson07_ fair, mhm he does also have anger issues
[4:00:07] fellathedude: Like in the VOD she just says Johnson Johnson Johnson
[4:00:08] danny_jr9_: basically you just need someone to cover your ass on the statements and make the other person look bad
[4:00:09] riftshadow: Lying in a report would get you fired, I think. But in saying that, a lot of bad policing happened in that situation.

[4:00:36] n3gi1: GUYS IN K'S VOD YOU CAN HEAR HER SAY STOP, BUT IN JOHNSONS EYES HE DIDNT HEAR ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIS NAME
[4:00:38] AnasKwTii: Hoppers only mad because Johnson goes easy on mr k their streamer

[4:00:46] Angel_ofMercy: lying by omission is still lying
[4:00:47] focustft: @xoMRoPINKox she says no, johnson at one point. Watch one of the YT clips with subtitles on
[4:00:51] buddha_hands: lying by omission is a thing
[4:00:54] Dsevex: Other officers lied. Bodycams needed over a character ter firing.

[4:03:15] whitemike84: it was good RP from an accidental punch from k i think it was great rp TBH
[4:03:20] PepperAnn131: The problem is that she says: "Johnson! Stop that!" But the last 2 words sound quieter in the clip, so it sounds slightly like "Johnson". Also, what nobody mentions, is Johnson saying: "I'm gonna lose my job!" So he clearly knew what he was about to do was wrong.
[4:03:22] ItsMavray: is lying when the detail change everything

[4:48:04] cSpiny: @Ssaab Can i ask u something ooc please ?
[4:48:05] Kevz95: from his perspective, nobody did tell him to stop, the other stuff is easy to forget, but overall he didn't handle it well at all
[4:48:06] goodtimes54: I was on his side without knowing the full picture, but if someone wont admit when theyre wrong what can you do. sucks either way
[4:48:13] FLAsox: im still tryna find the lie tbh
[4:48:15] MyDoSe_: Him saying why didnt you ask me more questions about it is really bad as an officer.
[4:48:15] xoMRoPINKox: he lied about the grandma hitting him like that LUL

[4:48:17] sanDIZZLEs: It was so wild. If it was just RP it would have been great but people were making it OOC

[4:48:18] dakota22446: sus
[4:48:19] n3gi1: are you reviewing the vod for us?
[4:48:21] ViralZeros: Cant make everyone happy lol
[4:48:23] iJerrBear: the man did suffer like 3 concussions after that whole incident, so maybe he forgot
[4:48:25] TheTourist_: fishh
[4:48:31] Eddie1225: @sanDIZZLEs its always how it is
[4:48:33] cSpiny: its about the hq app bug do u know about it ?

[4:48:34] FizzDidThis: catsittingverycomfortable
[4:48:35] dakota22446: fishh
[4:48:41] ShinJiHun: Combination of PD lying/being misremembering in some aspects and him misremembering others
[4:48:43] Cyrical: the other reports did lie right, they didnt tell him to stop, they just said Johnson..
[4:48:43] Abduleon_: wats ban eddie ?
[4:48:44] aguy02: anyone got a quick debrief?
[4:48:46] Eddie1225: people dont know how to separate RP
[4:48:46] Coopmore: not really sure why people get mad when bad things happen in character to their streamer, like thats part of RP, RP would not be fun if everything was favourable all the time for a character
[4:48:48] Eddie1225: and OOC
[4:48:49] ForgottenJones: fishh
[4:48:51] Cyrical: but IC you only know what you know
[4:48:58] Rare__Potato: donkHmmm
[4:49:03] Kevz95: @Cyrical no. she did tell him to stop, he just didnt hear it from his perspective
[4:49:04] hvnlydivine99: @cspiny is this about the drake video?
[4:49:06] Rossshki: why is it theres more ban eddie when the chat isnt in emote only?

[4:49:19] BlindBandit507: It's a conspiracy WutFace
[4:49:22] Dirk_Richter: Cause it looks bad if she didnt tell him to stop?
[4:49:23] xoMRoPINKox: HE DIDNT SAY GRANDMA SHE DIDNT SAY STOP SHE SAID NO once
[4:49:29] Bigbellzer: dosnt that happen all the time
[4:49:32] CuBanMumzy: maybe to CYA
[4:49:34] Clivent: they lied about den
[4:49:34] iJerrBear: @DocRavage maybe we will see him as a deputy in the future
[4:49:34] ShinJiHun: @xoMRoPINKox he did say grandma
[4:49:34] danny_jr9_: maybe trying to cover for themselves? but there wasn’t anything telling him to stop
[4:49:36] Kevz95: @Ssaab from k's perspective, he did hear her say stop, but he didnt hear it on his end. thats the conflict
[4:49:38] Zinnabunz: utter HUHW
[4:49:39] xoMRoPINKox: i mean i lied about not saying grandma lol
[4:49:40] Mic_Stargazer: @Coopmore I think its moreso when its extremely unintentional stuff t hathappens because of OOC issues. People forgetting or misremembering something OOC isn't RP. You can paly it off as RP but that's the player misremembering not the character
[4:49:40] braydentz: he didnt hear her say stop from his pov
[4:49:41] buddha_hands: especially funny that ppl hopping partially come from the person that made the complaint to begin with OMEGALUL complaint->punishment, surprise
[4:49:43] Purecrew: He did say Grandma but she certainly didnt say stop.
[4:49:44] Abduleon_: Gayge
[4:49:50] Krimson07_: ReallyInnocent
[4:49:50] miftie: it could be a great opportunity OOC for him with prio. I can see him really thriving in the city

[4:49:53] DocRavage: @ijerrbear that would be awesome
[4:49:54] Satic: Chatters still defending him lol
[4:49:54] Broseph_Brotato: Bones is a goofy little guy
[4:50:00] Abduleon_: Gayge ?
[4:50:00] dakota22446: sus krriiimson
[4:50:01] DoctorPez: Bones is great
[4:50:03] MWRGaming: still on BRB
[4:50:04] cSpiny: there is a bug where the jobs says that its a 1 week cooldown and its really 2 weeks
[4:50:04] TheMah1337: i dont think this matters he is gonna make good rp out of this, its all about entertainment
[4:50:04] Mic_Stargazer: It's the same way no one usually gets arrested over an unintentional punch even if its an officer or judge
[4:50:05] gblair09: @purecrew but was that in game or just to his stream?
[4:50:06] Cyrical: @boomershow824 his MDT is bright white

[5:30:39] Zinnabunz: YEP
[5:30:39] lookingfornothinghere: if johnson got fired for what he did there is NO WAY conan will sniff a job KEKW
[5:30:44] wavep987: Johnson could have saved himself. His attitude in that meeting deserved firing. He was shouting at superiors
[5:30:44] top_flamingo: my though on jonhson is that it was a bad situation in all. he was clearly panicked, rattled and wasnt sure what to do. so like what slacks said it came off like he was trying to cover something up.
[5:30:50] stuey_drake: ye but a lot of that was said in his head
[5:30:50] spencerpot: I mean as the streamer lot slacks? like after watching the vod
[5:30:53] Jettin: is there a way Johnson can rejoin PD?
[5:31:02] TripleDekeConway: Never give more info than asked. Don't incriminate yourself.
[5:31:09] RandomShungiteCD: @Jettin he can make a new chr

[5:31:52] ItsAHazardLife: I just wonder why Johnson got fired but people who didn't hold scenes or botched scenes bad didn't. Let alone if they wrote bad warrants. That's what I'm not understanding
[5:31:54] RonJon: @orangepowerguy hundreds
[5:32:01] Krimson07_: @orangepowerguy like 500 applications
[5:32:01] spencerpot: at Saab not slacks, do you think he should of been fired. like after watching the vod?
[5:32:05] WasamIAm: What if he didn't remember exactly what he said? Sucks to fire someone over that.
[5:32:07] top_flamingo: him making a written statement about the situation could have helped him
[5:32:07] 04jetta: @orangepowerguy 700+ last I heard

[11:16:07] PepperAnn131: Regarding the haircut: Turner told that weird looking officer to shave his head for running around 2ith his gun unholstered. Then Slacks ordered the FTO (Bones) to do so as well. Then later they both and a female officer came to Slacks and said they were called names by civs (for being bald) and asked for "support". And for that, they wanted Slacks to shave his head as well. After some coaxing, he agreed to a buzz cut.

[12:49:15] Augustiner: @saschka200  "Beamtenstatus" in Germany refers to the status of being a civil servant, or "Beamter" in German. Civil servants in Germany enjoy certain benefits, job security, and protections that are not necessarily available to employees in the private sector. This status typically comes with a high level of job security, regular salary increases, and a good pension plan.  ---- Where does it say the gov pays for everything?

[12:58:07] Xethra: Because she seeing it as snitching
[12:58:08] layla109: crim snitch code.. except when snitching on themselves *shrug
[12:58:08] sspungg: yea she’s pretty much telling on her self anyway
[12:58:08] focustft: she doesnt wanna implicate her friends, just herself
[12:58:10] Latertoyl: because she would have to throw her friends under the buss
[12:58:11] Latertoyl: bus
[12:58:12] Kingofthabears: she doesnt want to testify against her friends
[12:58:14] BuurmanDeBuurman: she just doesnt want to snitch on her friends
[12:58:14] Angel_ofMercy: she doesnt want to be seen as a rat on her people
[12:58:15] chivvyy: well pleading guilty to your own charge is a little different from essentially snitching on your whole crew
[12:58:16] zenyatta: she not trying to snitch
[12:58:17] tolluu: SHITSHOW
[12:58:18] enrise311: wait slacks turning into baas? LMAO
[12:58:30] supersupreme55: Because she said she doesn't want to
[12:58:31] sspungg: she just don’t want to stand up an say she has to be in the front of the room an now everone knows it’s me
[12:58:31] PepperAnn131: Because she understands it as: She might have to testify AGAINST her friends/co-conspirators.
[12:58:34] h0lk1: she doesnt want to snitch on her friends, I assume
[12:58:36] rclemon_: Look at this dudes hair ICANT
[12:58:41] Krimson07_: Wokege
[12:58:45] sspungg: but she’s pretty much saying it now
[12:58:47] Antaunik: I would tell her that she can just not NAME the accomplices specifically in court
[12:58:48] Latertoyl: just because she is willing to admit she did something doesnt mean she wants to testify against other people
[12:58:59] stellarnaut: she would have to testify she doesnt have a protections i imagine, but she could testify that it was all her idea
[12:59:02] Artsii1994: @Krimson07_ did you just wake up
[12:59:06] sspungg: she just don’t want to stand up in the public an say it what I sounds like

[12:59:23] No_bull_shet: how can 1 person duress 6 others
[12:59:23] Antaunik: "unnamed person A did this thing" and she isn't testifying against the defendant
[12:59:36] msdeell: fair
[12:59:39] kernalflock: can't stop won't stop
[13:00:10] Latertoyl: @Antaunik a judge would compel her to give names at that point, shes already been punished for the crime so there is no right against self incrimination at that point
[13:00:15] celestedgaf7: You can't make her testify but you can reference her testimony of guilt in other cases
[13:00:27] saschka200: Remember 10% of a company run the shit and she is not one of it
[13:00:39] Latertoyl: lol telling the truth in court is testifying though
[13:00:48] Latertoyl: what do you mean by telling the truth if not testifying in court
[13:00:49] celestedgaf7: That is literally testifying
[13:00:50] supersupreme55: She doesn't want to
[13:00:53] layla109: cooperating and testifying are two different things. I think sonya misunderstood cause she doesn't know how the law works
[13:00:54] meeto_tv: bro is still live ICANT
[13:00:57] BuurmanDeBuurman: she hears testify as = tell the truth about her friends
[13:00:58] humanhere2: She won't testify against the others, truthfully or otherwise...
[13:01:02] stellarnaut: her testimony is being subpoenaed i don't believe she can choose not to testify. Her only option is to testify and claim she doesnt know
[13:01:08] msdeell: yeah
[13:01:13] PepperAnn131: Exactly
[13:01:17] msdeell: she has a strategy
[13:01:17] Latertoyl: @layla109 hes telling her to tell the truth in court during a trial, thats literally testifying
[13:01:18] wavep987: pleading guilty vs testifying are two very different things. She agreed to the first.
[13:01:37] ButterVonWaffle: Calm down germany
[13:01:57] saschka200: Haha
[13:02:00] jadetortoise: stellarnaut but if she pleas guilty, she can't plea she doesn't know on the stand, that would be a bad faith plea deal
[13:02:10] layla109: @Latertoyl Of course he would say that. He's an officer.
[13:02:14] Jibry: saabStare
[13:02:23] rclemon_: Its me pick up saabStare
[13:02:26] Latertoyl: @layla109 but hes making it a requirement of the plea deal
[13:02:31] Latertoyl: which she doesnt want to do
[13:02:35] TheTourist_: still live classic
[13:02:41] Artsii1994: might be duncans secret number
[13:02:45] stellarnaut: @wavep987 she can choose her plea she cant really choose not to testify is shes being summoned to court, shes kinda trapped unless she pleas not guilty
[13:02:50] thatoneguyithink: its probably tony balogne
[13:03:10] TheTourist_: jfc what happened to his hair LULW
[13:03:13] saschka200: @buttervonwaffle you lost my respect the moment you use butter on  waffles
[13:03:36] aj42058: She's looking for a plea deal, not just pleading guilty, she's trying to get others out of trouble. IRL a deal like that comes with testimony & snitching. If she chooses not to, then no plea deal 🤷‍♂️ too easy.
[13:03:41] wavep987: @stellarnaut Then it can't be in the plea deal. They can bring her in regardless. But Slacks is dangling that as part of the deal.

[13:38:40] ogspeacetv: gotcha thanks
[13:38:56] DaZooKidd420: Does DNA stay on file forever after you get it or does it go away after a month or two? Kinda seems powerful to keep on file forever from one incident @ssaab just curious
[13:38:59] CincinnatiWiLL: whats up Ssaab and chat
[13:39:49] ogspeacetv: KEKW
[13:39:51] EnochBlanche: @DaZooKidd420 its only collected on Violent Felonies

[13:40:22] Grizzalopa: It'd be cool if there was a way to hack the MDW via the PC's crims have, allowing them to corrupt data
[13:40:24] PepperAnn131: Did she get a moment to say hi to Kirk?

[13:40:27] visvisony: Max is going to be giga mad when he learns Slacks is not in the station PepeLaugh
[13:40:46] sterred: @layla109 and tbf, the DNA only lasts for a short period on the actual item
[13:40:51] SirGO0SE: he'll be happy to hear Sonya is locked up
[13:40:52] DaZooKidd420: I know but if they do that one time they kinda fucked for the rest of the time on the server kf they leave dna
[13:40:57] Iron_Bjorn: 100% max is a patient man
[13:41:09] PepperAnn131: @FaramirRat Eugene said something about you can have your record expunged for 500k :O No idea if that includes DNA files
[13:41:11] No_bull_shet: crazy the prisoners get their phones even tho they stole the victoms phones

[13:41:32] talamah: moon2HUH
[13:41:37] layla109: @sterred Items, like objects/evidence?
[13:41:55] Grizzalopa: I feel like when you're expunged you should be able to GDPR your dna from file
[13:42:02] FaramirRat: @PepperAnn131 not many people have that kind of money in the city that is for sure, prolly other stipulations too
[13:42:11] DaZooKidd420: Sonya is a wild one I remember her from way back when
[13:42:15] sterred: @layla109 yeah, there arespecific conditions for DNA to actually be left on the item, and it needs to be run through the scanner quickly as it only stays on the item for a short time
[13:42:42] FaramirRat: for now, the DNA stuff can change
[13:42:45] PepperAnn131: Yeah definitely it's A LOT LOT, FaramirRat. But who knows how  that'll look 2 months from now :D
[13:42:47] DE_NUK3: wait isnt this a cop ?
[13:42:48] hydrozoic: Shouldn't a senior or something handle the transport and swabbings? Though maybe you just wanted to get out and about for a bit
[13:42:49] DaZooKidd420: Did anyone ask her about Max and his wife's phone they stole
[13:42:54] steve_more: 9999 months? Damn

[13:43:06] xRyan93_: chat what happened? why the 9's?
[13:43:16] irie_sen: @xRyan93_ HUT for witness tampering
[13:43:19] focustft: @xRyan93_ HUT
[13:43:22] Artsii1994: @DE_NUK3 no sonya isnt a cop thats her crim. winters was her cop
[13:43:26] Janizki_Fin: Hold until Trial
[13:43:34] layla109: @DaZooKidd420 True. Maybe the server devs will work to balance things out in the long run.
[13:43:45] jadetortoise: xRyan93_ sonya summers pled to the HUT charge, but the time/fine are to be determined by a judge
[13:44:00] PepperAnn131: Yeah the 9999 is only temporary, pretty sure. The judge needs to set the exact amount because of the witness tampering charge.
[13:44:01] xRyan93_: Thanks chat! : )
[13:44:20] rchouse: CodyFeelsLateMAN :)
[13:44:32] FaramirRat: Like any other game balance is an on-going and changing issue, WoW has been doing it for 20 years now, never right.
