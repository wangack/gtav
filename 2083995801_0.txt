[9:36:05] Saydiejayne: we had a cat who we had to wrap up in a towel when we gave her meds

[9:36:16] pickleviiiic: katesL katesL katesL
[9:36:18] fattydelrey: yeah cats are so difficult when it comes to meds
[9:36:39] A_Humble_Wooper: katesBlubbers
[9:36:43] MerrimanLyon: Having a cat with anxiety about being restrained like that is SO hard.
[9:36:43] kate87_: does she even refuse treat?

[9:37:04] jedi_raccoon: oh
[9:37:09] A_Humble_Wooper: Could you dip a treat in the medicine?
[9:37:11] firefrye: Housesitting for a dear friend, I had to give his elderly cat some meds she did NOT want to take. Had to look up a video on force feeding meds. I had to do the blanket burrito thing... if Loaf can't handle that I don't know.
[9:37:18] firefrye: it just sucks

[9:38:01] AziraphalesShop: Does she ignore the scruff too?
[9:38:02] A_Humble_Wooper: She's a large cat, yeah. And it's not fat, it's just big cat.
[9:38:07] Kthanid: Animals in a flight or fight response are WAY stronger than they appear.
[9:38:08] firefrye: I'm not. I'm just at a loss because that was the ONLY way I managed it...
[9:38:12] if0rg0t2remember: fear and adrenaline are not to be underestimated
[9:38:12] HurricaneChapman: Cats are freakishly strong for their size, and they're like, barely connected to their own skin, so you think you've got a grip on them but no you don't.
[9:38:14] MerrimanLyon: Once, my old cat spent three days not eating. We were panicked and thought it was the end for her, and she finally got her appetite back when she ate a little cheese. It was wild how fast she got her appetite back then.
[9:38:15] fattydelrey: have you seen the crazy cage smoosher some vets use now?
