[3:37:24] SSGHaseeb: your where the target LUL
[3:37:27] HeftyNYC: he looks like she scuffed too bc he was too close to the wall to swing door open

[3:39:22] evkay: They fired all the cops that spend the most time online and now they’re down tremendous
[3:39:23] maofinn: they needed to pull the driver tho
[3:39:24] luis_king82: cornwood shut the shit are you KEKW
[3:39:30] Mr_Tvi: They have tazers, but their sops make them only escalate one level at a time.
[3:39:31] SSGHaseeb: because of Sunday there are no many cops today
[3:39:35] Z3phs: the mechanic of cops pulling people out only works on driver. its game mechanic
[3:39:38] natty111000: thats why you dont pull someone out until they are locked in
[3:39:38] LaCucaracha7: wouldnt be shooting the tires an option? i dunno
[3:39:40] PrettyKrazy: shift 1 is... special
[3:39:42] of_the_Wolf: I coulda been a little more vocal
[3:39:42] Shikafrecko: nobody does tbh
[3:39:42] maofinn: it just happens
[3:39:44] chinnook: in 3.0 if there was a officer down they would shoot immediately

[3:39:45] Flashthatuuu: You guys got out cause I chose no. Terrible gambler
[3:39:47] FiFO915: why were they trying to take u out tho
[3:39:49] crookz_n_castlez: The branded cash
[3:39:56] Villenthessis: @of_the_Wolf GIGACHAD TOLAN
[3:39:57] ediblemaster: The standard operating procedures for the cops are way too soft. They can't use force much.
[3:40:00] justCoopp: get those steps in vee ladydimaDance
[3:40:01] theace8869: Do the walk LUL
[3:40:03] omar_imp: @Z3phs did that not change for 4.0? suarez seemed to imply you can pull them out
[3:40:04] joac1144: @FiFO915 She was the primary target
[3:40:06] AgadhiTheGreat: @Acie The same thing with the door happened to her which got her ran over, I think the doors look when the car is moving
[3:40:12] Tarikws: Idk i just saw Suarez POV
[3:40:17] FiFO915: @of_the_wolf W
[3:40:33] jewliaghoulia: yeah she would've made it back in the car if her character didnt start breaking the window
[3:40:36] SSGHaseeb: @evkay not 100% it also Sunday
[3:40:38] Z3phs: @omar_imp  you can pull them out, you need the baton out, and its a keybind. but it only pulls out the driver. it goes for the driver

[6:21:41] Tawdry___: no its only justification for robbing
[6:21:41] Freppuchino: cause theyre "CG"
[6:21:43] Supersamss: noone is actually selling at 6
[6:21:43] sssacrifixe: CG filled several GPU racks just by robbing sani
[6:21:44] evkay: Probsly do the opposite cos people are petty

[6:21:59] Dano_Leza: it could because jf they advertise on twatter more that 6 they will get robbed when they show up for the pick up
[6:22:02] ZatashD: People are not selling... and if they are it's to only one group
[6:22:02] garburst: if they rob it creates lmkr
[6:22:03] CorveIius: Shirley
[6:22:03] atuongo8: lol no way
[6:22:03] KasaneRS: no, because if people keep denying selling to them and keep doing sani even though they eventually get robbed chang gang will fall behind because doing sani gets more materials than robbing some
[6:22:03] Partyhead: supply goes down by doing this
[6:22:04] Rockhound__97: well they got to get cash from G6 then
[6:22:06] umudoffy: 100p qn excuse
[6:22:07] InfamousHoole: basic economics. The only way it'll work is if they rob people then sell the mats for 5.5 or 6 so everyone else has to sell less than that
