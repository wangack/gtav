[2:49:55] Livesies: @ramsie_silvercrow top 3 earners get an extra bonus
[2:50:00] itswolfman116: Is the background of the change or is it a scuff
[2:50:03] 3_A_B_C: the incentive would be investment and dividends later ?

[2:50:50] ImSurfinBird: xdd audit their bank records
[2:50:55] Livesies: @NickPenrhyn True.  Personally I think this is more like a tax like some MMOs put on guild members on everything they earn.
[2:51:09] Last_Paragon: NODDERS
[2:51:14] Piperken: -not- for whatever other stuff may be going on
[2:51:18] Clipperfan43: 2.0 Lang voice was classic
[2:51:19] Livesies: @NickPenrhyn Even a 5 or 10% is enough to really get the crew growing
[2:51:40] Progenr: Is there a meeting today ? Will Yuno show up or will you have to go and pick him up and drag him to meeting cohhPats
[2:52:27] Cal300: I feel like your are framing Dues and Kickbacks poorly. it should be framed as how fast does the group want to progress and this is how much progressing costs.

[3:02:37] simular: time spent
[3:02:38] AdLib_24: It's a valuable job
[3:02:39] SailorWS: yes its a part of the process
[3:02:39] skameeto: How much time does it take to clean?
[3:02:47] Danteroth: well
[3:02:48] lordandsavory: Hourly
[3:02:50] Unknowntart: shit is cooked
[3:02:52] EyeScraem: yea his work is worth more
[3:02:52] Danteroth: hes is putting in time
[3:02:54] Xernique: Yeah kickbacks should dictate the "earnings"
[3:02:54] HowlDestined: if you focus on cleaning i think it would be different
[3:02:59] RoyLeeTV: his job is actually crazy risky as well
[3:03:05] simular: true true
[3:03:06] Piperken: If you want cleaning to be prioritized, prolly need some incentive or recognition of it being done.
[3:03:07] Clipperfan43: Harry did it the other day and said October is crazy basically
[3:03:11] taylor2electricboogaloo: Yeah, I think the need to be clear about, do we expect you to generate $25k revenue for the crew, or do we expect that you bring clean cash, or do enough work that you get 25k in kickback
[3:03:13] RoyLeeTV: he's literally the finishline
[3:03:18] lordandsavory: $ 2166 hr
[3:03:24] DataRew: As a Data Analyst, this just feels like my job
[3:03:25] Omega16bit: if there is no money to clean there are no cleaning runs.
[3:03:27] EyeScraem: wouldn't make sense nodd
[3:03:30] ImSurfinBird: I'd say it is earning since dirty/washed money is essentially worthless
[3:03:36] Piperken: Cleaning takes time -.-
[3:03:43] Livesies: i think rolled, cleaned, and finished cash should each be valued as bringing cash in
[3:03:45] Karnall: so hes lost more than hes cleaned LUL
[3:04:02] nixhelix: well how fast is cleaning there might need to be a multiplier
[3:04:02] EyeScraem: might also incentivize other ppl to clean too
[3:04:11] taylor2electricboogaloo: You kinda already have a quantifiable value for that though, the kick-back amounts right, couldn't you use that dual-purpose?
[3:04:11] Necrowarp: @Karnall the money hes cleaned is money earned by the entire crew, not just his dirty money
[3:04:27] leshnator: So it's about getting a sense of how much a particular job is worth per hour?
[3:04:29] magidoss: ALOO
[3:04:30] Shuzan: but is it earnings?
[3:04:33] Clipperfan43: @necrowarp yup
[3:04:34] karrde2100: Propose time spent doing clean job = x and time cleaning money = some multiple of x?
[3:04:34] Lutre: NODDERS it should be valued highly due to it being the bottleneck for the crew's funds
[3:04:34] Citekare: geegaNODDERS yeah
[3:04:37] OphiliaCore204: do we know how he cleaned it? is it relevant?
[3:04:38] And0x: How Come marty never got kickback for the usb? Are those not worth  thousands  of dollars
[3:04:39] HowlDestined: I think the avenue of cleaning crew money is gatekept by being trusted with a key to the house
[3:04:58] Xernique: The kickback is representative of that value, no?
[3:05:00] zoingo: I'm starting to think I should start paying attention to these streams like they're Homework for my accounting class...
[3:05:02] Livesies: There's a conversion value between dirty money and clean money, the value he brings in could be the conversion rate
[3:05:02] Shuzan: yea its a numerical value to your work
[3:05:19] zerk159: Loving how organized this is
[3:05:21] SailorWS: does doing a heist job produce earnings that is counted to this? Thats a little grey
[3:05:27] ImSurfinBird: I'd argue that dirty money is worth only like 70% of clean money, by cleaning it the value is increased
[3:05:34] leshnator: You can also use that to incentivize certain jobs when they're most needed
[3:05:42] Drezzer1975: I know I'm completely lost at this point

[3:06:07] Livesies: @ImSurfinBird Exactly.  Octo's time value would be that last 30%
[3:06:09] roesslerm: Langs mind is more simple than Gigis... I recon Lang just meant upping the dues to 25k. LUL LUL

[3:06:50] Piperken: They honestly shouldn't complain over to what to keep track of lol
[3:06:51] leshnator: But after the first pipeline, it should still be easier to address other ones
[3:06:51] Xernique: Yeah makes sense

[3:08:19] Karnall: tax them i beg
[3:08:44] Soov: they can double dip on cleaning. so for cleaners  you could really ask for 5k clean per day, 5 runs each if they tag along
[3:08:52] MiG76: When racing starts up will the crew want a cut from winnings?
[3:08:53] Xernique: Should they give ALL their civ job money? Or just a portion?
[3:08:53] lemongrapel: Aware taxes
[3:08:59] Soov: considering its safer to have a partner while cleaning
[3:09:14] ImSurfinBird: Do you have an established value conversion ratio of dirty money to clean money?

[3:09:40] SanKiNshin: in her discord or twitter
[3:09:40] DogaBowl: take 30 percent from clean jobs maybe 🤔
[3:09:42] SailorWS: Clean jobs should get 10% back since its similar to the washed bill cleaning kinda
[3:09:55] SailorWS: just less risk
[3:10:08] SanKiNshin: @emilia_mila_ community discord or her twitter
[3:10:23] BoutsoftheBlind: they get a cool thumbs up okayM
[3:10:27] Xernique: Kickback from civ jobs should be a BIG portion I feel. Like 50-75%
[3:10:43] Shad0w_wizard: @BoutsoftheBlind good enough for me ok
[3:10:52] Oshiball: !discord
[3:10:52] Nightbot: discord.gg/geega Pick a faction and join the Mob Army!
[3:10:55] monsterh308: why give the clean money and wait for one kickback everyweek? why don't they just put the % they own the group and keep their cut?
[3:10:57] imtwopie: Clean jobs don't give any kick backs, but they do give a biiiiiig kiss from Lang Kissahomie
[3:10:59] hemishleroux: Is Tony burnt out on the game? I feel like I barely saw him lately in this stream and he was last in that thing she shared.
[3:11:00] taylor2electricboogaloo: I was thinking for the non-revenue earning jobs, use the kick-back % as a credit to their earnings quota
[3:11:01] leshnator: Yes
[3:11:01] RoyLeeTV: yea
[3:11:04] SanKiNshin: okayM MOP

[3:11:45] jmartian01: selling mats or earning mats for crew?
[3:11:49] taylor2electricboogaloo: You could give power to the Dons for them to 'hand-out' credits to their earnings
[3:11:50] laabsent: yuno for the morale
[3:11:53] ImSurfinBird: Crafting, Construction/Decorating, Information Gathering, etc. Hmm
[3:11:59] bursky00: Yuno also puts a lot in but he doesn't track them.
[3:12:05] qvbxx: that 1 time
[3:12:09] Omega16bit: clarify: Anything entered after midnight on Thursday gets counted toward the next week’s earnings?
[3:12:27] Charbydim: Too many sticky notes
[3:12:27] Xernique: Yeah, some sort of weekly follow-up on work for the crew seems necessary
[3:12:35] Piperken: SeemsGood
[3:12:37] leshnator: Having general bylaws for classifying jobs as deserving credit.
[3:12:40] imtwopie: nise
[3:12:42] ImSurfinBird: Similar to how the Treasurer is rewarded geegaNODDERS

[3:13:11] natty111000: but i dont know if people will write down what they do
[3:13:16] monsterh308: civ jobs should have to pay a tax, not receive kickback since the money is clean and ready to be used
[3:13:16] Piperken: It encourages more RP between leadership, captains etc too
[3:13:18] Xernique: Yeah thats a suprt good idea
[3:13:18] leshnator: geegaNODDERS
[3:13:19] Piperken: Doing that way
[3:13:21] karrde2100: Subjective RIP

[6:24:25] leiru1234: Lang onlyy vouch because of yuno

[7:27:37] ElmSt: the biggest issue wasnt even brought up ... marty wanted to combine the buttcoin farm and was denied ... seems like they dont want him to join
[7:27:37] martymagoo78: it all stemmed from Marty wants to be included, but in reality he took himself away from that by making a side crew with JP and then that created drama
