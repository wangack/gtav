[0:40:59] kangg: Hmmge

[0:41:10] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[0:41:11] laxwall11: Hmm I could see him doing it
[0:41:32] AshuraX13: True

[0:41:37] doc_sharon: katesPlot we have to be careful around all of them now

[0:44:43] if0rg0t2remember: didn't Slacks say "you have a warrant" when they looped
[0:44:43] doc_sharon: it could be like 5 different things for Wade KEKW
[0:45:00] Insaif: @if0rg0t2remember I think it was "you're going to have a warrant" after that.
[0:45:06] LilMaGooby: Suarez is probably most likely to push a warrant for something like joyriding
[0:45:13] AshuraX13: That's a good point
[0:45:17] if0rg0t2remember: the word warrant def came out of Slack's mouth either way

[1:14:14] CGAura: What is court? Feel like I've missed one?
[1:14:33] Insaif: Sewers > Sue Her > Court
[1:14:34] Denetti_: court = fence
[1:14:42] CGAura: I work in software dev I've seen worse named things

[1:15:02] Insaif: @doc_sharon I think Market?
[1:15:09] Kthanid: Chop -> Pork chop -> You get them from the Market.
[1:15:13] doc_sharon: gotcha
[1:15:21] AshuraX13: It's all very cockney
[1:15:22] CGAura: Is the house ouch due to someone falling down when it was just a hole before the floors went in?

[1:32:37] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[1:32:42] laxwall11: so she did give a statement?
[1:32:47] Kthanid: katesHUH
[1:32:55] KarnEvil: katesSip
[1:33:02] laxwall11: huh
[1:33:09] doc_sharon: wait what
[1:33:20] AshuraX13: katesPalm
[1:33:21] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[1:33:34] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[1:33:39] doc_sharon: katesPalm
[1:33:39] laxwall11: so her statement was that she was towing?
[1:33:40] BooksBlanketsandTea: they're a 1% MC KEKW I don't think "bullying" comes into it
[1:33:53] laxwall11: sus
[1:33:56] doc_sharon: giving the statement was bad, not retracting it is double bad KEKW
[1:33:58] BooksBlanketsandTea: especially if they think she snitched
[1:34:06] AshuraX13: That sounds so easy to retract
[1:34:09] if0rg0t2remember: that's the ADMC way just disrespect folks by showing up in force to their home
[1:34:12] laxwall11: hmmm
[1:34:42] AshuraX13: Going to be such an awkward BBQ katesSip
[1:34:57] 4taog: I get it, she's the VP of another club. She lets them force her to do something, they won't stop at just that incident.
[1:34:57] laxwall11: I dont trust that O is being honest with Lane
[1:35:01] BooksBlanketsandTea: @if0rg0t2remember it's almost like they're an MC and not the good guys
[1:35:18] doc_sharon: OK good
[1:35:18] Crafty_Crystal: wild they have a problem with a criminal denying being involved in a crime.
[1:35:24] doc_sharon: CLASSIC
[1:35:33] extractionss25: how could McNutty do this AAAA
[1:35:38] if0rg0t2remember: nobody said they should be the good guys, but you can have baseline respect for other clubs
[1:35:50] NoharTheShark: it's crazy that they wont tell someone what their own warrant is for
[1:36:07] doc_sharon: so much court KEKW
[1:36:10] if0rg0t2remember: yeah the fact warrant info is private seems odd
[1:36:14] 4taog: so far, ADMC hasn't seemed to show any other club respect.
[1:36:17] BooksBlanketsandTea: @if0rg0t2remember only if that respect is shown back. That's how MCs work. If they think she snitched, and she confirmed that she gave a statement to the cops? That's Wild disrespectful

[1:37:03] starangel76: katesFlower katesFlower katesFlower
[1:38:12] A_Humble_Wooper: Whether she actually snitched or not, it looks bad.
[1:38:14] Kthanid: The words "no comment" come to mind.
[1:38:14] doc_sharon: katesSteer
[1:38:21] AshuraX13: The statement looks so sussy, even if it is benign
[1:38:33] ThomasTheDestroyer: I mean, giving a statement and snitching are two very different things.
[1:38:33] doc_sharon: it's a bad look for O NODDERS
[1:38:35] LilMaGooby: I'm surprised how little Laney seems to care about there being a statement in the first place
[1:38:44] Crafty_Crystal: every time someone is arrested and says they didn’t do it is giving a statement to the cops.
[1:38:57] doc_sharon: katesNoted
[1:39:00] doc_sharon: we got this!
[1:39:02] AshuraX13: katesNoted
[1:39:03] Crafty_Crystal: unless they go through a lawyer
[1:39:30] mostly_minerals: Helloooooooo Chat n Kate! How's it going? katesHypers
[1:39:36] doc_sharon: hi @mostly_minerals
[1:40:01] BooksBlanketsandTea: @Crafty_Crystal the difference is not every statement ends up with a warrant put out for other people.
[1:40:02] doc_sharon: I love the court fits katesJam
[1:40:09] mostly_minerals: Hell yes
[1:40:37] doc_sharon: agree NODDERS
[1:40:55] Powercope: thats crazyyyyy
[1:40:56] Powercope: AAAA
[1:41:05] RubyBlade_: there's times to stand and fight and there's time to tuck tail and run for sure
[1:41:21] doc_sharon: OOOO
[1:41:22] doc_sharon: yum
[1:41:23] laxwall11: but also if it was like oh I thought I was talking to someone and they turned it into a report then that should be easy to retract
[1:41:28] AshuraX13: Yum
[1:41:31] ThomasTheDestroyer: If she named them or described them, then sure. If her statement was " I was towing all day. I don't know anything about what you are talking about." then that isn't to blame for the warrant. I am interested in what the statement acctually was.
[1:41:32] laxwall11: AAAA
[1:41:34] Crafty_Crystal: it would be a leap to think a statement like that would have impacted their warrants because they identified themselves to the victim
[1:41:38] doc_sharon: DOOOOO it
[1:41:49] hecktobreakfast: KEKW
[1:41:54] UppyFF: did you get bbq yesterday Kate
[1:41:56] AshuraX13: Beard's Birthday Treat for Kate? katesShy
[1:41:58] 4taog: I don't see any ADMC guys doing what another club tells them to when they show up at their house to demand it.
[1:42:02] doc_sharon: this is a popular birthday katesHm
[1:42:36] slackerdee: Hello Kate and chat!
[1:42:40] doc_sharon: katesCheer court time!
[1:42:46] doc_sharon: hi @slackerdee
[1:43:37] slackerdee: Having a clumsy day so I've grounded myself. I keep tripping over everything.
[1:43:48] A_Humble_Wooper: @4taog they have the numbers to back their stance up, though. The Raiders and the Lost combined are fewer than the ADMC, especially if you count people who wake up daily.
[1:44:29] doc_sharon: katesCheer katesCheer katesCheer
[1:44:35] doc_sharon: Peeporun
[1:44:38] 4taog: @A_Humble_Wooper I get that, but I also get a VP of another MC not backing down to that pressure.
[1:44:42] AshuraX13: Peeporun
[1:44:54] doc_sharon: Peeporun
[1:45:12] laxwall11: Maxx the sewer queen
[1:45:32] KarnEvil: be fun when maxx can spend some exploring time down here and not just fence runs. I wanna know what secrets there are
[1:45:33] doc_sharon: gotta think of the club NODDERS
[1:45:45] doc_sharon: Peeporun
[1:45:49] Kthanid: A swallow your pride moment, yeah.
[1:45:54] AshuraX13: We love it for spice Yesyes
[1:45:56] doc_sharon: true NODDERS
[1:45:57] mostly_minerals: As someone who just popped in, what was the statement?
[1:45:59] BooksBlanketsandTea: oh the spice is SO good
[1:46:02] kitingmare: that could also just seem like being a coward and also bringing "shame" to the club...
[1:46:05] rickbuh: Especially when she's the main one awake during the day, sounds like a bad situation for her
[1:46:06] hecktobreakfast: we do like rp 'round these parts
[1:46:06] NoodleCubed: potential spice between ADMC and McNulty will be welcome I'm sure
[1:46:08] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, there's a case to be made either way. So it'll be fun to see how O's player does things.
[1:46:15] BooksBlanketsandTea: NODDERS
[1:46:19] laxwall11: if that is the statement
[1:46:24] AshuraX13: That is a good word for it
[1:46:30] ThomasTheDestroyer: That is the equivalent of "I don't know shit"
[1:46:32] laxwall11: I still dont trust thats the case
[1:46:39] mostly_minerals: katesPlot
[1:46:43] doc_sharon: it's a bad look NODDERS
[1:46:43] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[1:46:56] MrOsey_: what is that word means
[1:47:03] mostly_minerals: Principles on snitching thingsss?
[1:47:20] Kthanid: seemingly innocent or harmless.
[1:47:21] AshuraX13: Yep, harmless
[1:47:22] Derkatronic: not dangerous, yeah, in this contexst
[1:47:23] A_Humble_Wooper: Not impactful?
[1:47:28] BooksBlanketsandTea: seemingly unimportant or harmless NODDERS innocuous (I think?)
[1:47:38] doc_sharon: katesYEP
[1:47:46] mostly_minerals: Especially with her relationship, she is under even more scrutiny.
[1:48:10] laxwall11: so does a higher fence rep let you stay down here longer or is it tied to something else
[1:48:16] doc_sharon: ADMC feels more of zero tolerance on it, which is valid for them NODDERS
[1:48:19] MrOsey_: ❤️
[1:48:20] ThomasTheDestroyer: ADMC also has an odd (to me) idea of what qualifies as "snitching".
[1:48:26] BooksBlanketsandTea: it's also possible that in giving a statement, she gave something away or said something important without even realising it. So she might think her statement was harmless, but it might not have been.
[1:48:31] AshuraX13: katesWaiting
[1:48:39] doc_sharon: NODDERS
[1:48:50] Kthanid: Any information could be harmful information.
[1:48:54] mostly_minerals: Yeah very much NODDERS
[1:49:08] if0rg0t2remember: its also assuming she willingly gave a statement which we're so far unsure of as well
[1:49:21] BooksBlanketsandTea: there are some INSANELY big brained people on the server. Like, watching Bundy in the old days? Detectives are Scary
[1:49:24] ThomasTheDestroyer: yeah, without knowing the particulars of the statement, it is hard to judge.
[1:49:41] doc_sharon: don't give them even a crumb NODDERS
[1:50:15] doc_sharon: katesPlot
[1:50:38] doc_sharon: this is all McNutty's fault KEKW
[1:51:58] doc_sharon: katesSip
[1:52:12] doc_sharon: I like that Maxx and Rue are on the same page NODDERS

[1:53:48] doc_sharon: I def thought they were coming back
[1:53:51] AshuraX13: katesHUH
[1:53:52] LilMaGooby: Hey, at least this extra time is giving you more immunity
[1:53:56] NoharTheShark: that was not communicated at all
[1:53:59] doc_sharon: katesSmile comms
[1:54:00] KarnEvil: KEKW I thought they were just going to the car
[1:54:03] A_Humble_Wooper: ok
[1:54:04] laxwall11: nope
[1:54:20] Kthanid: Yep
[1:54:20] laxwall11: they did
[1:54:22] doc_sharon: it sounded like that, yes
[1:54:23] PacMan419: but bread thought it out loud
[1:54:24] abblepiewit: that was my understanding
[1:54:27] A_Humble_Wooper: That's how I took it.
[1:54:29] NoharTheShark: looks like maxx needs to include pres and vp in comms training
[1:54:33] AshuraX13: I thought so katesShrug
[1:54:37] if0rg0t2remember: well they did go to the car katesGiggle
[1:54:50] doc_sharon: yeah likely an exec decision NODDERS
[1:55:00] KarnEvil: yeah, their comms are pretty good usually.  probably made a decision on the run back
[1:55:05] doc_sharon: either way, we will get it all to court Yesyes
[1:55:28] doc_sharon: katesJam katesJam katesJam

[2:45:55] A_Humble_Wooper: Yep. I don't know whether she actually snitched or not (and don't want to know because meta), but it does look bad.
[2:46:24] doc_sharon: NODDERS and her club
[2:46:33] laxwall11: also why do anything to help the cops

[2:46:57] CAYKE__: Sean's a good one
[2:47:01] A_Humble_Wooper: Yep, Irish earned his VP rank.
[2:47:16] Crafty_Crystal: All this doesn’t mean anything for the Raider’s now since they will know the truth at the court case.
[2:47:16] CAYKE__: Irish is filling very big shoes.
[2:47:27] AshuraX13: Are we Saususge

[2:58:28] Crafty_Crystal: It also looks bad on ADMC if they do something and there isn’t anything on the statement. It’s not their job to enforce other club’s members it’s the Losts job. So at least Irish seems to see that.

[4:54:25] if0rg0t2remember: chat how do we feel about ground beef vs cubed beef in chili?
[4:54:39] BedBones404: yeeeeeeeeep
[4:54:42] Kthanid: Ground is easier.
[4:54:43] AshuraX13: Agreed
[4:54:44] NoharTheShark: i get the costco canned chili
[4:54:47] Kthanid: I'm lazy.
[4:55:01] A_Humble_Wooper: Yeah, gotta be ground beef. Or ground turkey works too if you're avoiding red meat.
[4:55:07] BedBones404: i love the chili i make but sometimes i want a lil quick thing imma keep an eye out for timmy chili
[4:55:15] KarnEvil: I have done that.  Its great, but like, you need so much freezer space
[4:55:38] if0rg0t2remember: OK for non-beef chili I like to use half spicy italian sausage and half ground turkey
[4:55:56] NoharTheShark: we use ground turkey in our chili

[4:56:47] Nightbot: Follow Kate on Instagram! instagram.com/kate.ttv
[4:56:51] AshuraX13: Average cow is like 635kg
[4:56:53] A_Humble_Wooper: My family has a chest freezer, but but it's full of random stuff so still no room for half a cow.
