[11:54:28] ccoolracer128: couldnt that be a sink :D
[11:55:57] Vizi797: Their pre-done sink might even work there, if you wanted to save yourself building a sink, and them find the stuff for one.
[11:55:59] Random_Slacker: the barrel could stand upright by the stairs in the corner by the crate
[11:57:35] Vizi797: I forgot the toilet was attached to the sink lol
[11:58:18] Vizi797: Was that a train car? KEKW

[12:42:09] ccoolracer128: does it  need a door is the real question
[12:42:49] Okamaui: do you have to use the long drawer thing under the mirror? can you use a smaller one and make the bathroom more compact?
[12:42:50] Random_Slacker: is there room for a door on the bedroom facing wall? might be easier to fit in
[12:44:23] Random_Slacker: because having the door on the current wall, looses room for maybe having the desk against it
[12:46:47] VoltHound: leave the door where you have it but rotate it 180
[12:49:46] Vizi797: KEKW 󠀀

[12:55:35] Calvagh: HUH
