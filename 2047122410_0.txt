[5:24:03] Knebo_: didnt something happen at the end of that clip?
[5:24:06] LluagorED: snr buns seems to be full of a lot of noob folks, learning things maybe.  Like that guy just running with a wrench right on him.
[5:24:12] Suvaacc: i think snr buns has robbed so much that a lot of them are jaded about it also
[5:24:16] kronzillla: why trav
[5:24:20] KorbenDallas815: i hope there's new rules at snr buns after ak has worked there
[5:24:55] EpicHuggles: if the PD like did stuff it would be different as well

[5:25:04] np_lurker_flash: Facts
[5:25:09] kronzillla: say it NODDERS

[5:25:36] Gladie209: and then you have great rpers sitting in Q
[5:25:38] kronzillla: 250 slots really waters down the market
[5:25:42] six_o_nine: KEKW poor trav, this is a CONTENT server, CONTENT KEKW
[5:25:43] Succulent_ChineseMeal: I think another problem is civs don’t even report crime which makes it easier for crims
[5:25:50] narkkyboy: @woolfdesign fr too much ego and nvl and hero sht and grinding like an mmo
[5:26:01] cocofox3: imagine how public servers are
[5:26:03] Phatphuk420: @Gladie209 This is sad yeah, seen many..
[5:26:08] KorbenDallas815: all people at snr buns do now is max volume 'talking' it's terrible af
[5:26:26] six_o_nine: @travpiper you do realize you are approaching this from this mature POV right? ya can't expect a 18 ye old to have the same mentality, they want to be the biggest ganster and get Ws or w/e sometimes
[5:26:34] kronzillla: more content for ppls brands these days
[5:26:39] Suvaacc: EU tsunami i think has a lot more new people and you see these strange things more, cause most people switch to NA if they get prio

[5:28:01] krepana: shiti rp go back to fishing

[5:28:04] sharky_00_: I feel like you come down to not knowing.
[5:28:11] Jojojimmeny: It's an understanding that this kind of RP is two sided, it's never just about you
[5:28:13] Headss: Nobody really forgets a 'loss' in RP either
[5:28:17] krepana: LUL
[5:28:26] onix146: NODDERS fish in game
[5:28:47] Suvaacc: the ego thing i think is biggest noob mistake, cause every other game is ego driven, but in RP you have to push down your ego sometimes
[5:28:56] six_o_nine: @onix146 new character idea? Pog a fisher?
[5:29:11] SQUIDWARD360: This is like pro wrestling
[5:29:11] LluagorED: This kind of talk is why I like the Bestie group. You guys are all willing to take L's for story.
[5:29:14] Meltock: I wish more people played into being an actual character, feels like most of those are gone
[5:29:19] Jojojimmeny: I mean to those with egos, for most of them it's just "their story", rather than a greater shared narrative
[5:29:42] KorbenDallas815: @RecurveTV EXACTLY and fact
[5:29:47] blaydes4486: it doesnt matter age experience if your on a big WL server you have to play by the rules if you dont you should be removed
[5:30:07] KorbenDallas815: people who are only willing to take an l every 100 w's is dumb
[5:30:49] Techno_Plumber: Why were you banned?
[5:31:03] PFlan: sometimes it feels like it's less W/L issues and more refusing to share creative control which looks the same but is a different issue
[5:31:17] EpicHuggles: then swaped to class 2s NODDERS
[5:31:19] modernbezoar: 4.0 now bby

[9:28:49] slorebear: can you temporarily remove the electronics to test? or is that too much work or resources?
[9:29:25] MadChemistTHC: maybe put 1 rack in your apt and see what happens by itself
