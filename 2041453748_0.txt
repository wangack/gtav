[7:43:15] Fossabot: BBMC aka Bondi Boys Motor Club is a club which Dundee founded at the start of 3.0 alongside Barry Benson & Riley Carter. The roleplay storyline of BBMC during 3.0 has led to Dundee leaving the BBMC and now starting a new club with his friends Tommy & Aziz. The BBMC is something Whippy created back in NoPixel 2.0.

The roleplay storyline of BBMC during 3.0 has led to Dundee leaving the BBMC and now starting a new club with his friends Tommy & Aziz. The BBMC is something Whippy created back in NoPixel 2.0.
