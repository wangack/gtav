[4:07:15] mariolink213: @wishmaker10 actually yeah, license was 0/7 and also shares a letter with operate so its probably scuffed
[4:07:15] boosterronny: @superloika operate wasnt one of the words
[4:07:15] Eatchy_: yes your logic is good but you only using the right letter instead of using both wrong and right letter to know which one

[4:07:54] Winiii: @PjChubz Dentge
[4:07:55] dogsdogsdogsdogs: that one was probably operate
[4:07:58] crimecity_: @MagmaGuineaPig thats because the pc didnt have protection

[4:08:49] bjerre6969: license also end in e?
[4:08:49] Cheechill: omE
[4:08:51] Pure36: @ming isn't it about making a word out of all the words not guessing 1/9 ? Like maybe you had 1/7 letters correct in the word being created
[4:08:52] trueluve: mhm
[4:08:53] drowsyfeverdream: what the bin doin
[4:08:54] iKickMyself: that word wasnt on the list though

[4:12:56] iiTz_Adam: hes actually right its like wordle
[4:12:58] zvidrvhim: Was there any words that start with an O that was on the list?
[4:13:02] v6r_: session had o
[4:13:03] kayiithrall: its actually wordle lol
[4:13:03] Spartoriius: you type random words to find letters on the actual words
[4:13:06] Pure36: All the words make up a word
[4:13:07] dogsdogsdogsdogs: no
[4:13:08] djihtrax: pepeMath
[4:13:10] Rampardos: when marty got it right his word was TONIGHT which was on the screen makes no sense
[4:13:14] h116_: it is wordle but it just doesn't tell you what letters you got right
[4:13:21] dogsdogsdogsdogs: did he have to find the words in brackets like in fallout?
[4:13:22] kickerstwitchtv: YES MING!! 100%
[4:13:22] PrinceReborn: typical besties scuff
[4:13:22] Pexk78: is this wl or pub

[4:13:25] jockstarraidz: @whishuo truuu bruh i would for sure
[4:13:26] MrYeOLDsNIPeR: yea, but doing that it still told you 0/7
[4:13:27] zeeshan072005: @Rampardos it was in the list ?
[4:13:28] kayiithrall: maybe thats why get got 0 BUTC tho?
[4:13:28] Spartoriius: @Rampardos it still makes sense
[4:13:34] Rampardos: @zeeshan072005 yeah
[4:13:34] kayiithrall: even though it said it was "right"
[4:13:35] surtren: True
[4:13:36] scorpion1869: also just like fallout hacking
[4:13:36] superloika: Or that was just a fake reveal so that the hacker wouldn't have the idea that the correct one is one of those words. Extra complexity!
[4:13:37] twirlyD: none of them started with O and none of them had P 2nd so
[4:13:37] caliarcana_: guys so if you DCED in wifi the hack doesnt go through ?
[4:13:43] enjoylife4789: Tbf…to operate you have to be careful you need a license its a session and it takes elements and I don’t remember the other words
[4:13:50] Just_Tom: like matrix writing
[4:13:51] nut_in_tissue: @wekeepstriving and license read 0 KEKW
[4:13:52] dkakr: oop

[4:14:01] Yzma1: @caliarcana_ exacly
[4:14:08] chaoticcalm93: Ming you are right
[4:14:18] ChristineSedai: I'm confused. None of the words started with an O... right?
[4:14:23] prmanu: I got u cousin
[4:14:28] Kloakheesten0: im like 99% sure it was just scuffed LUL
[4:14:30] chairwatch: wouldn't it be hard to tell which letters are in the correct placement?
[4:14:32] scoobyjew5: why don't they have any butcoin?
[4:14:34] kxnicks: yeah marty's correct word was actually on the screen so it was prob scuffed
[4:14:35] twirlyD: none of them started with O and none of them had P 2nd so i dont get how the random words help. you ccould just type any random shit to guess
[4:14:36] padlordruki: marty got yours lol he was mad that he spent 5 butcoin and hacked 0
[4:14:36] genericusernameuno: Maybe Marty hacked someone without the protection and ming hacked someone with it which is why he didn't have the right word
[4:14:40] Kdog_____: theyre gonna get hacked
[4:14:40] Winiii: 98% sure it was scuffed......
[4:14:49] enjoylife4789: @christinesedai a O just has to be in one of the words
[4:14:56] zeeshan072005: Do it with him ? PauseChamp
[4:15:00] thylootgoblin: not much rp involved in this mechanic
[4:15:03] VacB_: it said 1/7 bc 1 letter in the word was right?
[4:15:07] enjoylife4789: don’t have to start with it
[4:15:12] chairwatch: yes
[4:15:15] superloika: @genericusernameuno Oh yeah coz it has protection level. That might be the one.
[4:15:17] VacB_: yeah thats wordle
[4:15:20] kayiithrall: @VacB_ and both end in e too
[4:15:22] eaglezFly: i think 1/7 just meant 1st of 7 tries
[4:15:26] ChristineSedai: @enjoylife4789 But I thought Decline and Operate were 1 correct because of the last E?
[4:15:27] chaoticcalm93: yeah true there was no O or P
[4:15:28] BlueishKiwi: it was scuffed
[4:15:31] mirrorzqt: Practice wordle on the website @Ming
[4:15:33] Naphtax: might be higher security level makes the word not be in the list
[4:15:33] m160jI: operatE declinE makes sense mhm
[4:15:33] juneOT: there was no words with O OR P tho
[4:15:33] Morph_: someone gonna get all the butt

[4:15:36] Phoenix__08: yours was scuffed
[4:15:37] TheRealitsFLY: urs was just scuffed
[4:15:41] prmanu: what u thinking sire
[4:15:41] chairwatch: but how would you know which letter 1/7 is correct?
[4:15:41] chaoticcalm93: so you must have to guess well and guess the last 2
[4:15:48] Eat_Some_Rice: is it wise to give out your address
[4:15:49] oDelilah: mhm
[4:15:50] mrozzyoz: fanny is good with word puzzles, she'll probably get it EZ. seen her playing viewer games on jacks stream a couple  times
[4:15:50] VenGGeance: lets go
[4:15:53] y3ll0wmustard: if that was the case, how do you know which of the letters is correct?
[4:15:57] twirlyD: @enjoylife4789 wheres the P come from then?
[4:16:02] Dankbudbaker: inbefore he hacks his own pc Lol Kappa
[4:16:05] h116_: laREEE
[4:16:09] dogsdogsdogsdogs: when he started the hack did he have to reveal the words by finding them in brackets and parenthesis? because if so i see one he just didnt expose
