[0:54:55] MzVampire23: I worked retail and a lot of older people kept telling me that the self check out is taking over my job and that I’m not needed and I’m just trying to do my job and make sure they pay and if they needed help I was there.
[0:54:59] VeilOfBats: Working in Retail is one of the worst I have heard
[0:54:59] gamers1700: I've heard so many retailers tell me that by the way I make my request they were happy to check based on my approach
[0:55:03] l_eeka: Your fits have been going hard lately
[0:55:10] xxunicornxx99: @VeilOfBats yeah ive also heard oop
[0:55:12] gaugedis: my mum is an awful customer and im just standing there just not wanting to be
[0:55:13] Kesin86: My friend worked at the Gap, the manager didn't like him and put him in the back of the store.  My mom didn't help the situation when she would shop there by saying he was the one who helped her, even though he wasn't on the floor, and he would pop his head out the back and wave .
[0:55:17] emmadeeee: @bigsmokeddog69 I hear it alot in Scotland
[0:55:26] ak321: where did you get your pearl/bead necklace
[0:55:27] Rdaems: Oh yelling for no real reason , u gonna enjoy working in the culinary sector then dizzyTea dizzyLul
[0:55:50] emmadeeee: @ellum can't be worse than having people sucking up to you for being the managers daughter
[0:55:52] eli5540: it's also counter productive because naturally people are less inclined to go out of their way to help you if you sre rude to them
[0:55:57] jibebecologne: oh definitely
[0:55:58] zenbee97: I'm blessed with a good manager!!
[0:56:07] jibebecologne: me too
[0:56:09] Adam402: I don’t get what managers think they achieve by being cruel how is it productive or motivating
[0:56:32] ebbubble: samee
[0:56:33] zenbee97: 100%
[0:56:38] mai_lupa: 100%
[0:56:43] aperson264: yea true
[0:56:50] xxunicornxx99: 100% yeah
[0:56:52] its_klljoyy: I’ve quit three jobs because of management specifically.
[0:56:53] Twincy_N: KEKW true
[0:56:53] nickysimss: LUL you tell em
[0:56:54] aperson264: the inclination isnt there lol
[0:56:57] elsmeganxo: people also complain about the prices being wrong on dvds and vinyls and once a customer was stood there shouting at me and rolling there eyes at me, i always end up saying that i cant control the price
[0:57:00] xiinbad: Most of the times, we're not in control of the "decision" if you're getting a refund or not as we always have to refer to the manager(s)
[0:57:02] gamers1700: Forget the respect disconnect, you start thinking 'is there something in what you said I'm doing wrong?'
[0:57:12] eli5540: 100%, it's people thinking they are above you just because they are in a leadership roles
[0:57:14] xxunicornxx99: @nickysimss nickyyyy! peepoHey iLOVEyou
[0:57:19] Kesin86: ELLUM GIFT 100 SUBS!!!!! I mean, Ellum can you gift 100 SUBS (hehehe)

[0:57:33] faybz_: managed a pet shop for 2 years, loved the people I worked with but 1 rude customer would ruin your entire week
[0:57:46] kieraowen270: the place I’m working at has parking time limit and people come in to complain that they've had a fine yet they are the ones that say they won’t be staying long when we tell them to put their reg in
[0:57:46] Rdaems: Good thing u never worked in a kitchen , u wouldn't do anything most of the time then dizzyLul dizzyTea
[0:57:51] gamers1700: @Kesin86 that was a New Years thing LUL
[0:57:52] nickysimss: @xxunicornxx99 lfsHI
[0:57:59] Adam402: I imagine managers at companies with high turnover might feel it’s not worth their effort idk seems rude tho
[0:58:02] MzVampire23: The worst part is when older people (even young people) give you attitude for no reason. I’m
[0:58:08] MzVampire23: just doing my job lol
[0:58:09] Kesin86: @gamers1700 yep, I remember.  Good times
[0:58:10] budrun90: i think context of the situation matters for things like that too. Like if your getting ready for an event and someone is just delegating and such it makes sense. but yeah, i get it.
[0:58:12] xxunicornxx99: @Kesin86 that was for new years lol

[1:00:16] budrun90: i was a manager at a grocery store for a few years and i always tried to treat everyone like I wanted to be treated. I would go push carts with the baggers and help clean and stuff too. just trying not to be too good to do someing I am asking them to do. you know.

[1:03:39] Rdaems: Personally i had no problem with the yelling etc , i just got tired of the strain on my body etc in the kitchen thats why i switched to an IT career 5 years ago @ellum dizzyTea

[1:06:54] zenbee97: How's Dundees crew going?
[1:07:06] Adam402: @rdaems in law it’s not so bad because usually both lawyers know who is right and who is wrong, but you just have to put what evidence you do have forward and leave it to a judge
[1:07:18] Adam402: it’s not usually the case that the debate wins a case, but the evidence
[1:07:22] Adam402: but also who asked XD
[1:07:29] Kesin86: Ellum is a roomie and friends
[1:07:42] Rdaems: Adam402 yh wasn't talking as lawyer , was more speaking in general arguing among regular people
[1:07:42] xiinbad: It's also knowing when to walk away realizing that some people are too stubborn to admit that they're wrong or maybe they need that time and space at that moment
