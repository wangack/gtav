[3:27:52] sahgress: @KorbenDallas815 na, it is supposed to be like that, they don't want it to be like 3.0
[3:27:58] Athasin: It's not a bug it's a feature
[3:27:58] xx_josh0_xx: can you hold it down forever and it doesn't decay?
[3:27:58] THE503GIO: Is it per click or per amount of time you using radio?
[3:28:06] shekan123: It's a good thing that it decays faster with use rather than time
[3:28:08] djihtrax: oohhh wow
